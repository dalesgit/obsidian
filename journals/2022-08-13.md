## Journal Entries
-  Morning on the beach with Mike and Martha. I read *Funny Times*, and laughed a number of times. Mike knew of the publication but didn't want to read my copy.
- Bob and Brenda are coming to visit tomorrow. I asked MP, "What was the time that you felt closest to Bob?", knowing that she has not every felt close. She struggled with the answer. It reached back to elementary school days. Bob was often angry. Joe was the athletic (and smart) one. 
  
  I pointed out that Bob has been the one to facilitate family: videos, parties.
  - Installed the hanging bar in laundry room. 
  

## Gratitude
- So much has been put into place for our situation here. Am I up for it?
