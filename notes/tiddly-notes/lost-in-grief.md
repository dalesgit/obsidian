# LostInGrief

SpiritualDirection

Lost is a place, too

Loss I might be grieving:

1. Leaving Hawai'i
1. Lydia
1. Emma
1. being 70 y/o
1. standing in the church
1. identity as a priest
1. not involved in grandchildren
1. loss of identity as a "parent"

After reading today 2021 / 02 / 06 / 05:28:36 / it seems possibly another is:

1. loss of luminosity in writing â€“ often expressed in preaching and teaching, pastoring, etc.
