# Planning St. Paul's

What is the inner work needed at St. Paul's?

* many are saying, "We need healing." What does *healing* mean?
* video to share asking, "What is the origin of your spiritual life?" "From your childhood, what led you to this place?"
* Do weekly dinners and lunches, several parishioners, making possible the conversation, "What is important to you about St. Paul's, the church?"
* Doing things the way we always did doesn't seem viable.
* 2nd service justified? For Rite 1 and no music, is it justified? meeting a need of the body of Christ?
* am I accepted by the different factions in the congregation
* Sundays off? 5th Sunday? every other month?
* "blocks"? means what? Morning, afternoon, evening?
