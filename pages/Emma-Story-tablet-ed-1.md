## Precious daughter
Since the 70's my first instinct was to root for the girls over the boys.
	  
Fathers and daughters. Fathers and sons. I have wrestled with my relationship with my parents. I have tried to be sensitive to the dynamics I see in others.
	  
My teacher at Notre Dame, John S. Dunne, told me once that one's spiritual life didn't begin until both parents were gone. His whole career had been built on pulling his broad Catholic spirituality and mysticism out of the clouds and into the stuff of every day life. I heard from someone that in the 70's, when students enrolled in the fall, there were a myriad tables spread out -- you know what I mean, labeled "A-Az", "B-Bz", and so on. There in the cavernous geodesic dome, there would be one table set aside as "Prof. John Dunne."

Isaac was fooled (was he already a fool in his old age?) by his wife Rebeccah and son Jacob to bestow the blessing on the someday named "Israel" instead of the hairy eldest, Esau.
	  
Since my own childhood, I have spontaneously rooted for the underdog. Did I see myself as a perennial underdog? Did it seem all the more magnificent when the undervalued prevailed?
	  
It seems related to an old adage that a parent loves each of their children in the way that they need loving at any particular moment. It was intended to defeat the claim of one child or another that they were the "favorite".
	  
Emma was the last child I sired. The baby, as it were. I am writing this memory, because this last of my children has been the subject of more anguish than any of the others. It is because she was special, I guess, in some way.

## Conception
So much of her early life there was a swirling around me, a roller coaster of up and down. I spent lots of energy trying to re-vitalize a congregation. I spent energy throughout the week trying to nurture a step-son. He accompanied me to church on school days because he attended just across the street at the Catholic School. That lasted until it was time for middle school.…
## Birth
I was determined to be present at the birth of Emma. I had been forced from the delivery/operating room with Lydia when the spinal block failed. My response wasn't exactly, "You don't know who I am." But something like, "You really don't know who I am." I knew of myself that I could take any amount of chaos and emergency and I would not faint and would not cause trouble. Of course, hospital protocol prevailed. But for Emma, I was determined that that wouldn't be repeated	

So I was present for the birth of 4 of my 5 children. 
	
Nothing was unusual in the several days that it took for Emma's mother to recover. Then we prepared to head home. Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes. Mother in the mandatory wheel chair. Then off to the elevator. As soon as we entered a loud alarm went off throughout the floor -- perhaps the whole building. The doors froze and there was no going up or down. 
  
A nurse had forgot to clip off the identification bracelet on Emma's ankle. That was my Emma.

## Fathering
When Lydia had come home from the hospital, Bridget seemed to have difficulty knowing what a mother was to do. I felt like Mo had taught me something of that and I tried to step in. Perhaps Bridget resented me for that. I was something of a "La Leche League" coach for her. Encouraging her in ways that I had learned from earlier experiences. I "mothered" Lydia in significant ways. I was the one who could quiet her at night. I took pride – that's an observation to be wary of – being able to sooth her at night, put her to sleep in my arms, comfort her when nothing else or no one else could accomplish it.
	  
Emma was a different story. Her mother was a little more confident in her ability to nurse. I now needed to pay even more attention to Lydia as Bridget was focused on her new-born. I felt an inner pressure to open my heart to Emma in compensation for the extra time I spent with Lydia. It was right and proper that Emma's mother be the primary care-giver at this point

And so it was that I began what I thought would be an innocent time of fathering and nurturing two little girls. They shared a bedroom then. Emma in a crib and Lydia in the "big girl" bed. I solidified my deepest intention to be the best father ever. I thought I knew deep within that I could do it by growing a love within me like an oak tree or baobab tree. I read, I fed, I rocked, and read stories. Lydia seemed to naturally melt into my arms after only a few minutes of rocking. Emma, on the other hand, seemed to demonstrate a "strong will" from the beginning. When she was upset there seemed to be now way to get past it with gentleness. She would fall asleep after she was exhausted. Again and again.
	  
I changed diapers and gave them baths. I was conscious of being a male in a female dominated family. I was ultra-sensitive to gender issues as related to privacy and appropriateness. This was made especially present to me as it was during these years that the church was increasing at great speed it's awareness of and sensitivity to abuse issues. From the beginning of my marriage to Bridget I was aware that my approach to relationships was vastly different from hers. The differences were manifest in the way we approached parenting. I was utterly committed to a mutuality and sharing of parental roles. My sense was that Bridget [[Bridget]] was far more committed to traditional roles of fathering and mothering.
	  
Does it make any difference so many years later that both my mother [[Mom]] and my brother [[Bill]] thought that Bridget and I were mis-matched and inappropriately wed? If I had known how skeptical they were in 1991, would it have made any difference?
	  
One little illustration of my parenting with Emma was a sort of game we had as I took her into her preschool. When I took her out of her car seat I would hoist her onto my shoulders and we would proceed into the front doors, ducking because with her height above me we didn't fit the doorway. How little I could have suspected where that little gesture would lead.

## The Police?

It seems impossible to reconstruct at this late date. But it seemed unbelievable even as I was living it. 

I arrived at her school to pick her up and was informed that she wasn't there or that she wasn't available for me to see. In some mechanism that I can't remember now I was informed that she had been placed in some kind of "protective custody." As I write this almost 30 years later it seems like it must be about someone else. I remember frantic converstion with "authorities" that moved quickly from embarrasment to outrage. By Sunday at an interview with a police detective at our home, it was clearer that someone at Emma's daycare had reported suspicious behavior that led to initial questioning of Emma that led to the conclusion that this was a case where reporting the suspicion of child abuse was required. 

At a later conversation I had with the director of the daycare, it was revealed that the person who started the whole cascade of vicious official action was a South American raised daycare assistant who had recently attended a required training session. She had observed me habitually carrying Emma into the daycare on my shoulders and that seemed inappropriate to her. Questioning Emma led to "discoveries" that I sometimes had oversight of Emma's bathing at night time. Not very surprising since I was often the only parent available 

There are the things that I can remember as the facts of the case. As I have learned over and over again in my years, memories of one person can easily divert from another's rendition. As I write this some 24 years later, I have been hearing repeatedly on our ship's MSNBC channel a news anchor cry out, "We live in a post-fact world." For years I have heard from students and others making reference to "my truth", or "one person's truth is not the same as another person's truth." I am old enough to have absorbed a classical and long-lived understanding that **truth** is not something changing, but in fact everlasting. 

It was in my 11<sup>th</sup> grade American History class that I experienced one of the important conversions of my life.  We had been assigned the rather simple sounding task of determining who had fired the "shot heard round the world." Our **evidence** was provided for us in the form of 6-7 testimonial statements about what happened at Lexington - Concord that day. They ranged from next day reports in a news story to letters written through the years and an auto-biography from decades later. The evidence was, of course, conflicting. It was the thing that left me thirsty for **history** the rest of my life. It is the thing that helped me fashion an understanding of history as primarily **story**. It is at the heart of a later conviction, fashioned in doctoral seminars at Notre Dame University, that all of our talk about God (**theology**) is essentially metaphorical. At whimsical times that leads me to claim that the most significant human language, the language that is closest to God, is poetry. Where is the poetry in lies that lead to the alienation of a child from her parent?

But how am I to apply those convictions in this particular case? It would seem that among the "stories" that Emma's mother passed on to her after our separation and divorce is at least something along the lines of "where there's smoke there must be fire." Perhaps the fabrications have been more explicit than that? I don't know because I have never been able to get an explanation from anyone in a position to know. 

In fact it seems astonishing to me that a child could break a relationship with a parent and that parent know so little about what caused the rupture. This is what I know.So much else is conjecture on my part.

1. My bishop in Hawaii told me that he knew Bridget had told our girls things that, in his words, "No parent should tell a child."
2. My brother David had a number of conversations with Emma over the years and at one point he told her that her words don't match the Dale that he knows.
3. At Emma's graduation, a long time friend of the family, Tim Vail, came walking up to me in a very aggressive manner. He spoke to me, intending to intimidate me, saying, "Don't you ever hurt Emma!"

> I was startled because I had no idea what he was talking about. What I know these many decades later is that at that moment that there was no one in the universe less likely to intentionally hurt Emma than her father. 
> 
> My initial thought was that he was acting from some unspeakable deception. I thought, "How dare him!" I spent some time and energy with my spiritual director, trying to work out what to do with that information. At one time I had thought of him as a friend. As with much of this affair I have felt a good bit of betrayal. As it seems increasingly likely that I shall come to the end of my days without knowing what was going on, I shall have to be content with accepting the not knowing as mystery and grace.

The detective who came to our house concluded that there was absolutely no evidence of any improper behavior, and in fact said that there was plenty of evidence of abundant love. What lessons am I to take away? 

- Overreach of government?
- Unintended consequences of "no tolerance" policies?
- The broad attraction of libelous stories?

## Bicycle

Several aspects of Emma's personality led me to think she would not be susceptible to propagandistic strategies. One is that she has demonstrated from the beginning a fierce determination at whatever she had her mind set on. When she was still an infant, if she had her mind on demonstrating her unhappiness, there was no quieting or comforting her. The only strategy was to wear her out.

An illustration of this behavior is immediate circumstances of her learning to ride a bicycle. She followed her big sister's bicycle, riding her tricycle and then a bicycle with training wheels, until the point she couldn't take it any more. She was going to learn to balance. One memorable day she did it. She got up on the bicycle and rode around and around the cul de sac. The only thing is that she didn't know how to stop. The only solution she could find was to run headlong into a large shrub at the neighbor's driveway. Down she went. But there was no doubting that she would get right back up and practice her braking.

I have photographs of the two sisters, buried deep in the leaves of racked from our yard. Two sides of our property were completely forested; so there were lots of leaves to gather off the lawn. The laughter and joy evident on the faces of those two girls has buoyed  me ever after. 

Another characteristic of Emma's arose only later when she was "double-digit" in Hawai'i. She learned about *Facebook* and took to it immediately. She was hooked on the social feedback she got. There were warning signs. She was the victim of cyber-bullying at *The Priory*. The perpetrator was given reprimands and punishments, but Emma would be susceptible to the persuasians of her audience. 

## Determination to swim
Emma's persistence would be demonstrated also in the process of learning to swim. Each of the daughters had been exposed to Lake Michigan from an early age. Lydia had a special love for the water, even when it was uncomfortable child. When it came to the drive across the country, culminating in our move to Honolulu, both girls were determined to learn to swim. I remember their brother Julian coaching them at a motel pool in Colorado Springs. But it was landing in Hawaii that the passion hit full throttle. There was a pool at the condominium we were staying in. It was desperately child, but each girl pushed the other to "swim". Initially that was swimming underwater the width of the pool. Then the length was attempted, but that ultimately meant figuring out how to come up for a breath. For the life of me they quickly looked like fish -- or mermaids -- in the water. We were just a short block from the beach at Waikiki; stop their time in those early days in Hawaii was split between pool and ocean. 
## In church
Emma's single-mindedness and independent steak was evident in one event that has remained for me through these many years as one my most precious memories. As children of the parish priest, they were comfortable moving around the various places in church. That would include the worship space (sanctuary) and the sacristy, as well as behind the scenes places. At the church of their youth there were two panels on either side of the altar space. These covered two doors going to rooms behind the sanctuary, and on one side the equalizer and amplifier for the PA system was shelved. 

Going back years to a previous church I was a member of, and involving my oldest child, Owen, I had become persuaded that the best place for young children was right up front in church, not shuttled behind windows and crying rooms. So my children were accustomed to be right in the midst of whatever was happening in church. So it wasn't surprising when one Sunday the whole congregation was suddenly jolted by a shreek (sp) coming from the PA system. Emma, age 3-4, was quickly discovered behind one of the panels and had turned knobs, including the volume knob, all the way on. That memory illustrates something of Emma's personality, but it is another memory that is so endearing to me.

One Sunday the bishop was coming for his annual visitation. Now on normal Sundays Emma had established her own tradition regarding the procession out at the end of the service. She was seated there in the front pew. She would watch the choir and other assistants go by. Then when her father (me) brought up the rear, she would step out into the aisle and walk out beside me. On this particular Sunday, it was the bishop who came last in the procession rather than her Daddy. So, as the bishop walked past her, she very ceremoniously, with a kind of "Harumph" on her face, stepped out behind the bishop. It was if she was proclaiming, "If I can't walk out with my Dad, I'll walk out alone. In the place of prominence."

- She would frequently request Harry Chapin's "Flowers are red" as we drove to the Priory or somewhere else around O'ahu.

## Her size belies her energy
In the year 2000 my brother was married at Cape Cod. Our family would drive from Indiana to Massachusetts. In those days, prior to 2001, it was possible to travel in Canada with a driver's license. We drove down Michigan and crossed the border at Detroit and headed up Ontario. Somewhere along our route, perhaps at a gas stop, there was a little pony ride. The girls had never been on a pony and they both wanted to give it a go. I have a picture somewhere of Emma a top a little pony. But she was only 6 and petite in size. This small little thing, wanting to put on a face that she was able to be in charge. It's a charming photo.

More striking for me is the image I carry with me when we got to Niagara Falls. I had never been there. We stopped on the Canadian side and walked out to the water's edge through a stone building. There we were, standing in an outdoor porch, a large stone hedge between us and the Niagara River. The river flowed past us and dropped down the falls just a few yards to out left. There was river spray all about us, but my chief memory is of a sense of awesome power flowing past us, just feet from where we stood. And Emma wanted right up there, as much on the stone hedge as she could get, peering over at the mighty river.

Small in size, but don't let that fool you.
## Sisters
Before she could decipher numbers, she pulled off the classic move that children made with the old rotary phones. Kids these days have no clue what it means to "dial" a phone. She was in a crib at the home of "Mama Sue" Vail. The phone was within reach. Emma dialed "9-1-1" because of where those numbers appeared on the dial. The sheriff's office showed up at the door. I gather he was known to Tim Vail and asked him if there was any issue. They figured fairly quickly that Emma was the source of the call.

Once I was shopping at a grocery store with the 2 girls. Emma was in the seat while Lydia sat in the basket. I was buying just a few things and got to the checkout in fairly short order. But it was long enough for Lydia and Emma to get into a ferocious disagreement of some kind. As the one in charge I wasn't sure what to do as we moved into the space for the cashier to deal with us. I still remember vividly the words of that wise woman. She looked directly at me, smiled, and said, "They're sisters!"  She ministered to me that day and she taught me a little about what it means to grow up with a sister.

Sisters often have a very special relationship. Not exclusively positive nor negative. But a deep bond. One night when the two girls were in "double digits", I had a sudden epiphany. I was able to get it, I think, because for many years I was the person who put them to bed. I heard their last thoughts before they went to sleep. For many years I sang a special song for each of them. For Emma it was "Thank you, Lord." For Lydia it was "Sing, God, a simple song." They shared with me what was going on in their lives. The insight that night was that each of them was envious for what the other had. Each of them thought the other was better. Perhaps more loved. I don't know. The way I interpreted it was that each girl looked at the other's particular gifts and thought that that made the other more important or better than herself. I thought, "If only they could each see what her sister sees in her."

## Pikes Peak
The next year, we made a trip to Colorado. The two girls and I drove straight through from Michigan City to Colorado Springs. It was for their big sister Miriam's high school graduation. The trip pre-figured our drive later that year when we moved to Hawai'i. The trip in June is remarkable to me for the trip up Pikes Peak that we made with my oldest son, Owen, his wife Michelle, and their just about 1 year old, Madison. Although I lived in Colorado Springs for 10 years, I had only been on the top of the mountain that towers over the town. I had climbed it one February 1<sup>st</sup>. There was no one else around, the wind howled on top of the peak, and we almost had a disaster as we glissaded down a snow field.

This time we went up the cog railway. For part of the hiking trail we had followed the rails of that train. This time it was physically so much easier, and my 2 girls, 6 and 8 years old could make it this time. We weren't alone, however. 

We arrived at the time and both girls were so intrigued to see snow all around. And it was summer time! But, alas. Emma quickly became profoundly ill with altitude sickness. She couldn't really move without discomfort, and it was all she could do to sit and watch her big sister play in the snow.

I think Emma grew up seriously disliking having an older sibling who got there -- wherever "there" was -- before her.
## First grade in Hawai'i
We arrived in Hawai'i after the school year had already begun. There was some debate at home about what to do with the children and how to manage those early days. We considered enrolling them in the school nearest the condominium in Waikiki. I think the school was "Jefferson." With only a little inquiry we established that it didn't have a very good reputation, and we settled on focusing our attention on getting a permanent place to live. The data about the different schools was an important component of our search for a place to live. We moved into the townhouse in Hawai'i Kai on Oct. 4, 2001. It would be our home until 2011. We enrolled the girls in Kamiloiki School -- "The small milo tree."

My sense of Emma's schooling that year was that it was uneventful. Lydia had more trouble adjusting, but Emma seemed to go with the flow. Later the challenge of schooling would become more apparent. There was some ambivalence about whether the *Priory* was the right school for Emma. It clearly was for her sister. Did she vacillate about going? I can't remember. Perhaps she wanted to follow in her sister's path. Perhaps she wanted to blaze her own trail. But I knew that her needs were very different from Lydia's.

A few years into our move, the girls' maternal grandmother came down with terminal cancer. Bridget went to stay with her mother for an extended stay in her last weeks and months. We talked on the phone about the challenge of keeping continuity with the girls' schooling and their emotional connection with their grandmother. I asked the question in terms of:
1. Since we don't know when she will die, we could plan to have the girls visit before she dies, providing a last memory of her still alive, or
2. We could plan to have them come to a funeral after she dies. Bridget agreed to the first plan. But then the inevitable suddenness of death made that problematic
We made the travel plans anticipating I think 2 weeks of missed school. Grandma died the day before our flight back to Hawai'i. There was a bitter conversation with the family where I was informed that I didn't have the right to a voice in what was to happen with my children. They were with their grandmother as she died at home. It was, I think, a traumatic event for both of the girls. 

Scheduling trips to the mainland had been a source of conflict and fractured communication. I made several professional trips to the mainland in our first few years. Two times I was part of a delegation from the diocese as the Episcopal church tried to avoid splitting apart. I went to meetings prior to the General Convention of 2003 where the election of Gene Robinson, a practicing gay man, to be consecrated a bishop, was confirmed. I went as  the representative of Hawai'i to the meeting of the Episcopal college chaplains. Ironically the main agenda of the meeting -- which I didn't know til I got there -- was to disband. I made two trips to the mainland for the national church sponsored clergy events called **CREDO** -- "clergy retreat, education, discernment, opportunity."

It was at the first of these, 2004 or 2005, that the pattern was established that Bridget would take a vacation to her family without me. She maintained that until the end of the marriage. On alternating years she took the girls with her. We had taken one family vacation in the first few years. It was the only diocesan convention held on a neighbor island in living memory. We took the children out of school for 4 or 5 days. We hadn't pre-arranged that with the school and we got a very serious phone call on  Maui where we were informed that the girls' absences would be "unexcused" and any missed work could not be made up.

Through all of this Emma working hard, struggling at times, flourishing at other times. The Priory (their school for High School) required the students to take music of some kind. Emma chose the violin. She wasn't a star, but she was good enough to continue all the way through 12<sup>th</sup> grade. Soccer was where she really began to make a space for herself. She was good enough at AYSO that we agreed to have her join a club. She advanced pretty well until a fracture and a very poor coaching action one year left her just "one of the girls on the team." Both girls paddled on the Priory team. 
## Exchange students in the home.
From a time before my second family I experienced a dramatic illustration of the redemptive and grace-filled opportunity that an exchange student brought. Because of my involvement with the Rensselaer Rotary Club, I was given the chance to host a student from Brazil. His name was Paulo. My memory is that at least Bridget got to meet him, so that would have been after 1991. Perhaps he had returned to the U.S. with his family for a visit and he made a side-trip to Indiana? 

In any case the whole experience was so positive for me that I was very receptive to  new and similar experiences. Through my position in the church, I networked with a number of people who were involved in various temporary placements and exchange opportunities. 
### Mia
The first one, for me, however, came in a kind of serendipitous acquaintance with a young woman whom I knew then as Pi'ikea. In recent months I have reconnected with her and she goes by the name "Becky". She worked with the diocesan ministry team working with college-age students. For a time I was the diocesan person in charge of that group. Pi'ikea's husband, David, was finishing a law degree at U.H. and needing to get positions that would facilitate his advancement. At first he was a part of the Honolulu Prosecutor's office but then got a position with the Maui Prosecutor. He felt that he needed to take the position. The fly in the ointment was that Pi'ikea's daughter and just been accepted to the main campus of Kamehameha Schools, located in Honolulu. I made the offer that Mia could live with us during the school year and begin her time with Kamehameha. They all thought it was good idea. Mia was close in age to Emma.

They became friends and I gained another daughter. I would drive all 3 girls into town in the mornings, dropping Lydia and Emma off at The Priory and going on to drop Mia up the hill at Kamehameha. It was as far as I knew a splendid arrangement.

What I didn't know was that Bridget was having problems relating to Mia. As was the case throughout our marriage, I never understood what the dynamics were. I don't think it was my weakness as a communicator. In any case, just before Christmas of Mia's first semester, I was tasked with telling Mia's parents that "it isn't working out." They had to scramble, because there were serious family issues involved with Mia's attendance at Kamehameha. Pi'ikea was so gracious to me, and they eventually got Mia enrolled at the Maui campus of Kamehameha. I lost track of them until late in 2022.

### Leen
My next effort to bring to our family the exchange student experience was more formal. It involved hosting a student through a program that sought to link students from former Soviet and Arab states in the middle east with families from the U.S. The intent was to provide cross-fertilization of cultures to make communication better and at least indirectly influence the course of difficult trends in geo-politics. The process required a fairly rigorous vetting process. 

Our student, Leen Al Yaman, was from Lebanon. She arrived in Honolulu a day or so before Bridget and the girls were to return from their vacation time on the mainland. I picked Leen up and drove her toward Hawai'i Kai. I stopped at one of the beach parks to let her put her feet in the Pacific Ocean. The quite appropriate and careful rules of the program meant that Leen couldn't come to our house that day since it was just me. She stayed with a friend of Lydia's who lived in Kailua. That family had passed the required background checks since they had previously hosted a student.

The memories are rich from our time with Leen. She attended the girls school, The Priory, and settled into the academic and social life quite smoothly. I remember preaching the next Sunday when Leen was first in church with us. The text was Jesus' encounter with the Syro-Phoenician woman -- from Tyre or Sidon. With Leen now part of the family and her family in Saida, Lebanon -- otherwise known as Sidon -- it seemed to me as if the whole episode had the stamp of God's approval. That was part of my sermon that day.

Later Leen would go with Emma to a renewal weekend called *New Beginnings*. This particular weekend didn't require one to be baptized; so Leen would be welcome. My sense is that she enjoyed and valued her time there. That and conversations she had with me and others led Leen to read the Quran for the first time. I learned after her return to Lebanon that it was the beginning of her renewed (New Beginning?) commitment to Islam. To this day I think of that episode with deep gratitude. 

Leen was genuinely accepted at The Priory and at graduation in the spring, Leen danced a belly-dance down the aisle of St. Andrew's Cathedral. I felt like a proud parent and I still think of that with a gladness of heart.

There was, however, a dark cloud. As with so many other things about my relationship with Bridget Kubley, I was not permitted to know what the nature of the dark cloud was. There was some kind of alienation involving Lydia. Leen moved to Emma's bedroom and they became better friends. Bridget never really appreciated Leen after about Christmas that year.

For my part, I felt that Leen was like a daughter to me. I told her as we dropped her off at the airport for her trip home that wherever I was for the rest of my life she would have a home if she needed or wanted it. I wrote a letter to her parents where I tried to share with them the joy I had experienced during our time together, and I thanked them for sharing their daughter with us.

## Break
During the entire time that Leen lived with us Bridget and I slept in separate rooms. I never knew what Leen (or indeed my own girls) thought about that. I knew it wasn't normal. I knew that it was a sign of the deep brokenness in the marriage. It was a part of what contributed to me making the decision that the example I was providing Lydia and Emma was destructive to their ability to find and accept love in their future lives.

Emma became more and more independent, and my influence over her life was less and less. One episode in particular stands out during that time. Emma was convinced that it was OK for her to spend the day at Waikiki Beach without adult supervision. I was equally resistant to that notion. Bridget utterly supported Emma and scoffed at the idea that I had a right to input on the matter. 

Towards the end, I became aware -- perhaps Emma told me -- that she wanted to do 2 things when she turned 18 and she didn't need a parent's permission for: getting a tattoo and going sky-diving. She had determined that I was out of her life when she turned 18. She accomplished the 2 things she wanted to do.

There was an exchange that in a kind of symbolic way stands as the final act between Emma and me before the estrangement that infected our lives. We were in the carport in back of townhouse. Perhaps we were getting ready to go to school or some other event. One of us made reference to the darkness that pervaded our household. I had known for a long time that it was palpable and noticeable by anyone coming into our midst. Emma looked at me and said, "Just fix it, Daddy."

I didn't know then, and I don't know now, what she meant by that phrase. At the time I assumed that she understood, as I had understood for a long time, that the relationship was un-fixable. I interpreted her phrase at the time as, "Just do something, Daddy. Don't let it linger in this netherworld of yuck." In later years I have thought that I incorrectly assumed things about what Emma knew or thought. As the estrangement between us has grown into a death, I recognize that there is much that I didn't know or understand.

As I have grown older, and now approach the twilight of my life, I am aware that the things I don't know or understand are immense and growing. There is so much about life that is a mystery. I have understood for a long time that the goal of my life doesn't have to do with accomplishing things. The shortest expression of it is that I want to be able to end my life and be able to say, "Thank you."

Are there things I would do differently if I had them to do over? Surely. If that is what constitutes regrets, then perhaps I have them. As regards Emma, the thing I am most aware of is gratitude for having her in my life for a time. I know that throughout I did the best I knew how. 


## Life is fleeting

I Associate with her the movie *Rent* and the lyrics.
"**COMPANY**"
525,600 minutes, 525,000 moments so dear.
525,600 minutes - how do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee.
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife.
In 525,600 minutes - how do you measure a year in the life?
How about love? How about love? How
about love? Measure in love.
Seasons of love.

525,600 minutes - how can you measure the life of a woman or man?
		  
**SOLOIST 2**
In truths that she
learned,
Or in times that he cried.
In bridges he burned,
Or the way that she died....
		  
**COMPANY**
It's time now to sing out,
though the story never ends
let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends.
Remember the love!
Remember the love!
Remember the love!
Measure in love.
Seasons of love! Seasons of love.
## Apologies that this is incomplete
