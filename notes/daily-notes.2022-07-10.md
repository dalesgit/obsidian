## Journal Entries
-  The other day I started reflections from [marginalian](marginalian.md) with "H is for hawk."
- Today's gospel is *Good Samaritan*. The reflection from Notre Dame's reading of the day says this:

> Writing in the post-World War II era, political theorist Hannah Arendt bemoaned that most evil in the world is done by those who never make up their mind to be either good or evil, for failing to respond is an evil of its own.

I think I made up my mind a long time ago and recognized that the much of the world might disapprove. 

> Choosing compassion sounds good but is, of course, much harder to execute. At some point, we assume every role featured in today’s parable—the one injured, the one who passes by, or the one who stops to care.

Then there's a reference to the experiment [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) mentioned the other day about seminarians, preparing a sermon on the "Good Samaritan" pass by someone in need -- an obvious application of the sermon.
- another read from [marginalian](marginalian.md) is about William Blake. I think I identify considerably with him: both mystic and craftsman, poet and theologian, marginalized in his day.

I am something ashamed of myself at even daring to write that I identify with such a towering human being. It is the creativity, not the quoting or cataloging, that makes such a man. But I have put down some scratching here or there and dared to "make a living with my words" as I frantically put it shortly after ordination. 
## Gratitude
- Dreaming in the morning about [Lydia](Lydia.md). It felt like she was going to be "OK". I heard her when she said that this was the first time she had traveled and somebody else wasn't in charge. When she traveled last year with [Emma](Emma) it was she who made all the decisions. Lydia thought that she was going to do "OK" even though she was anxious.

I love her so much.
