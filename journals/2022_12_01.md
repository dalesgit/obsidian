- Got business cards printing correctly. I needed to use Linux printing with "no margins".
- Talked to [[Bill]] and Karla. He might reach out to Lydia. He assures me that David is not upset with me. They just got back from Mass. The movers will come for their stuff the day(s) after Christmas. Katrina called him to ask about going to the wedding. Bill / Karla both got checked for hearing aids. He may end up with cheaper alternative, since they don't have **Costco**.
