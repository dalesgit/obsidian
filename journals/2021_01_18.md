	  I really am grateful for the vaccine we were able to receive today. It is a reminder to me that this imprisonment may end some time. The todo function in this software seems helpful to me. It helped to allow me to get the basics of my 317 in place this evening.
	  
	  I don't look forward to seeing Janet tomorrow. Maybe that means it will be grace-filled.
	  
	  I got to walk. Iliad and Odyssey.
	  
	  I had an insight from the lecture. Odyssey has as a theme the basic truths about human life, one of which is the reality of loss and separation. The many years he was away from his home, Ithaca, the place was without a head.
	  
	  Insight: That is the condition of St. Paul's now with Fr. Jim. They are without the head. They are dis-eased until the situation is remedied. I imagined writing a little parable about that to send to Charlotte.
