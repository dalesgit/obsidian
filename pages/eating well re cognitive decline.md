If you can still sing along to every boy band song of the early 2000s and can recite your childhood best friend's phone number, you might be thinking you'll never have to worry about memory challenges.
​
While it's true that a minority of Americans are officially diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's disease, it's probably far more common than you might expect. According to an October 2022 study published in [*JAMA Neurology*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.3543?guestAccessKey=019682c2-546b-47ef-918a-c881c1fae686&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=102422 "(opens new window)"), 1 in 10 American seniors is [currently living with dementia](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/), and another 22% of those 65 and older experience mild cognitive impairment; one of the early signals that more serious cognitive challenges may be on the horizon. That's about one-third of all individuals 65 and older.
​
Cognitive decline naturally occurs as we get older; it's natural that our ability to remember details, understand, learn and think degrade slightly over time.

[Family history](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7922542/way-to-reduce-dementia-risk-even-with-family-history/) certainly plays a role in the risk for dementia and other cognition-related conditions, and scientists have discovered a variety of habits can also move the needle. Things that have been previously shown to reduce the risk for cognitive complications later in life include:

-   Eating [more fruits and vegetables](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015873/fruits-and-veggies-improve-memory-research/)
-   Keeping a [stable blood sugar](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001377/having-diabetes-can-speed-up-cognitive-decline-here-are-5-things-you-can-do-to-help/)
