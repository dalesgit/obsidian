# Time-of-the-Magicians

Just beginning this tome, but immediately it's focus is obviously the post-modern developments that would be of interest in RELG 317.

I'm reading in the book about Heidegger's attack on Descarte's basic programme of questioning of the reality of what's "**out there**". His "Dasein", hi "**Es gibt**" which must be understood in their basic German context so as not to turn them into philosophical "concepts" reminds me of the lecture on S. Freud today.

There I learned that in German, Freud's "Id", "Ego", and "Superego" are not jargon but ordinary German words for "I", "It", and "Over-I".

Lectures on Religion&Evil. also
Postmodern.

The confluence by 1921 was that all 4 men understood that **language** was at the basis of all knowing, truth, insight about reality â€“ all of which is a "modern" way of putting it. [all so desperately leading to relativism and solipsism?]
