# Discussion: Chapter 7

## Inner process of change

-  (p. 91) "Jesus quite clearly believed in **change**. In fact, the first public word out of his mouth was the Greek imperative verb *metanoeite*, which literally translates as “**change your mind**” or “**go beyond your mind**” (*Matthew 3:2, 4:17*, and *Mark 1:15*). Unfortunately, in the fourth century, St. Jerome translated the word into Latin as *paenitentia* (“**repent**” or “**do penance**”), initiating a host of moralistic connotations that have colored Christians’ understanding of the Gospels ever since."

> **Is that important for us? For yourself? For the church? Why?**

## How God keeps creation both good and new

- (p. 95) "Jesus’s many parables of the Kingdom, which lean heavily on the language of growth and development. His common metaphors for growth are the seed, the growing ear of corn, weeds and wheat growing together, and the rising of yeast. His parables of the “Reign of God” are almost always about finding, discovering, being surprised, experiencing reversals of expectations, changing roles and status. None of these notions are static; they are always about something new and good coming into being." 

> **What does this inform what the church should be doing? What are the implications of this?**

## The story line of Grace

- (p. 96) "The steps toward maturity, it seems, are always and necessarily immature. What else could they be? Good moms and dads learned that a long time ago, and Cardinal John Henry Newman brilliantly captured it when he wrote that “to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.”"

> **How do you deal with change? How do you think the church needs to change to live into God's future?**

## Traces of Goodness

- (p. 99) "Love is the energy that sustains the universe, moving us toward a future of resurrection. We do not even need to call it love or God or resurrection for its work to be done."
