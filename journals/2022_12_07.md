- Readwise trial ending
	- Thanks for taking the time to try Readwise over the past 30 days. Unfortunately, now is the end of your trial and in order to continue using Readwise you'll need to:
	- [Upgrade your account](https://readwise.io/upgrade?ref=downgrade&et=fcb3794b-fb42-4b27-a730-79cf1d7d05ff)
	- There are two plans:
	- Readwise Lite, which is just the daily review & email, or
	    Full Readwise which gets you all of our hardcore features like tagging, note-taking, Evernote, etc.
	- If you're not ready to upgrade, you can also refer your friends to use Readwise and get an extra month of full Readwise for each friend who joins.
	- Until you do one of the above, you will no longer receive your daily Readwise emails or be able to review your highlights on the Readwise site. You can always export your data in csv format or delete your account, however.
	- Regardless of your choice, we want to say thank you for trying out Readwise. We know it's been an investment of your time, and we appreciate you giving us a chance :)
	- Thanks,
	- Tristan & Dan (the Readwise Team)
	- PS. If you have any questions or need any help, please don't hesitate to reply to this email. We'd love to chat!
