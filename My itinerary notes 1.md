Top 3 Reasons To Book

-   Parque Vargas and viewing Limon's seaside City Hall
-   At Casa de la Cultura, live Calypso music and dancers
-   An interactive Caribbean gastronomical experience

Learn about, experience firsthand, and enjoy the history, culture and flavors of Puerto Limon as you travel with a local guide.

Your day begins with a very short drive to **Parque Vargas**. Set out on a **walk** that acquaints you with the park and with the small seaside City Hall and ending at the famous "Pasaje Cristal", an informal art exhibit. Here you will enjoy paintings, sculptures and other Costa Rican art. Continue to view beautiful Uvita Island just offshore -- this is where Christopher Columbus landed in 1502 on his fourth and final voyage to the New World.

Board a coach for a scenic **panoramic drive** along the coastal road towards **Playa Bonita Beach** where you will visit an open-air plaza to enjoy a live **Calypso band and dancers**. Feel free to join in and dance to this special Caribbean rhythm.

At the historic United Fruit Company building, an interactive **Caribbean gastronomical experience**has you preparing traditional Caribbean cuisine, including a local version of rice and beans, tastings of the mild-spicy 'Patty' and the tropical sweet plantain fruit -- all part of your **snack** menu for the day.

Return to the pier on foot by simply crossing the street to the port. **Shopping** for souvenirs is easy, as artisans and vendors host a market that you will pass through before boarding the ship.

Notes:

Participants must negotiate stairs and/or uneven surfaces and is therefore not advisable for guests using a wheelchair or for those with mobility limitations. Minimum age is 8 years. Bring insect repellent; wear sunscreen. Wear comfortable walking shoes and dress for the weather.

Top 3 Reasons To Book

-   A rural drive to Bahia de Caraquez 
-   The seabird sanctuary at Isla Corazon
-   The Bahia Museum of Archaeology 

The two-hour drive to **Bahia de Caraquez** follows a route lined with banana, rice, onion and mango plantations, as well as a dry tropical forest and a cloud forest. 

Upon arrival in Bahia, try a typical regional **snack**served with fresh juice. 

Hop into a **dinghy** that will take you to **Isla Corazon**. Isla Corazon is a bird sanctuary -- a nesting area for many different marine birds. Keep an eye out for the hundreds of frigate birds, pelicans and anis that call this area home. 

Back in Bahia, **lunch** is served at a local restaurant. 

Returning to Manta, stop at a _manteño_ ranch to learn about the **manufacturing of Panama hats**. Despite the misleading name, Panama hats are, in fact, made right here in Ecuador and have nothing whatsoever to do with Panama. From boiling the leaves to weaving, ironing and rolling, you will see all the steps involved in producing these fine hats and have a chance to purchase a hat directly from the producers if you wish -- a _superfino_ memento of your time in Ecuador.

Make the most of some **free time** to take photos before heading back to the pier. 

**Notes:**

Wear comfortable walking shoes. Bring biodegradable sunscreen, insect repellent and a hat. You may get a little wet during the dinghy ride. Minimum age is 2 years. Minimum height is 2 feet. Maximum weight is 280 lbs; maximum height is 6'10". Tour is available only on select sailings. Disembarking on Isla Corazon is weather dependent. All bird watching takes place from the boat.

En route, and at the islands themselves, you will observe rocky islands, dung birds, fishermen at work on their boats, and a **Humboldt penguin colony**. A huge group of sea lions will likely meet your boat. They live in complete safety because there are no predators here, and they will likely play, swim, jump and dive around you.

Heading back to the pier, your boat travels past shoals and rocks that are crowded with **bird colonies**, rounding out your **marine nature experience**.

**Notes:**

Tour operates weather permitting. Exact itinerary depends upon sea and weather conditions. Bring your own binoculars. Restrooms are only available on the dock before boarding the boat. The boat is not covered. Participants must be in good physical condition. Bring a towel. Shade is limited; to avoid sunburn, wear long clothing suitable for use as a cover-up.
