Hello, my title is 2021 / 01 / 13 / 22:45:45 /

This morning

To Karen I responded to Mary Pat‘s admiration for my love for her and gave examples of my response to her surgery..

I said that I didn’t have to think about that that it came naturally without thinking. Then I thought of the love I gave first to my older three and then to my younger two children. I said it would seem for my experience that to love profoundly doesn’t pay off.

In the end we die. Or as in their case they die to me. But then I said not unlike "Jesus on the cross".

My lectures on Religion-Evil make something of the same point. The words from Leonard Wolfe's autobiography written in early 1960s. He recalled Virginia Woolf calling to him that Hitler was giving a speech, it was 1939. Wolf said I’m not coming to listen I’m busy planting irises. And they will be blooming long after he’s dead.

A sign of the hope that we plant in the face I have so much experience to the contrary.
