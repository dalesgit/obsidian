	  * I am grateful for:
	  * What surprised you this day?
	  * What did you learn this day?
	  * Daily affirmation: QuoteFeed
	  * How could I have made today better?
	  * What would make today great?
	  * Three (3( things that happened today
	  
	  in 317:
	  
	  * I completed preparing the quiz for Module 3.
	  * Not open yet.
	  * Prepared the documentation to accompany the presentations, posted modules 1-2.
	  * Module 3 presentations and documentation not yet posted.
	  
	  Preached at St. Paul's Monroe.
	  
	  I got the task todo thing working here. There's programming in this. But it is malleable to be an extension of my inner-working?
	  
	  
	  Watched an avant garde movie *Searching* – all filmed on screen. It was impressive as a pioneering work of story-telling. Since it played off of a father losing a daughter it wasn't fun for me.
	  
	  Also I spent the whole of it sitting next to Sean. And I hated it. It ruined the entire experience. Why? Why? I've got to figure that out. Is it because of the contrast between a present child and an absent one?  Grieving getting in the way of other feelings?
	  
	  
	  I'm grateful for Charlotte's reaching out to me. Her acceptance of my insight – also Henry's.
	  
	  Insight, affirmation. Henry has the same difficulty with Charlotte appreciating his ideas as I do with Mary Pat and mine.
