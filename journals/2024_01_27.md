- I’ve disabled git-obsidian plugin. Trying to just use working copy on phone. 
	- This seems to have worked. I am writing this on the Samsung. I had to wait for the Android + Obsidian-git to work through the steps it needed to take. But after 1-2 minutes it was complete. I'll see if this gets back to iPhone.
- Then we'll see if I can get Logseq working.
