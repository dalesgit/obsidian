# Discussion notes
- Heard from them the story of how they met. It was so charming. Then shared with them how we met. It was refreshing.
- Lynn seems especially fond of [MaryPat](MaryPat.md). She promises to come visit.
- Just as they were picking us up, the Jenkins's pulled up behind them. They were dropping off a check that had mis-addressed. But they playfully made fun with the fact that they had **caught us in the act.**

- [x] Key Dates Completed or Scheduled. We were glad we rethought our getting together
