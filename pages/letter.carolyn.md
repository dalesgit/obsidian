Dear Carolyn,

I am writing this to an address I got from Owen, my oldest son. He’s not entirely sure that it’s the correct address, so I’m not at all certain that you will get the letter. If you do get it, I’m even less confident of how you might read it. I have heard that you have been told that I and my brothers did not want to speak to you or see you. That is not the case. This letter is a brief effort to explain myself with the hope of beginning a conversation.

Your introduction to this part of your/our family tree has been skewed by the timing and by the source of your information. The timing was the very process of our mother's dying. The source of the information was our sister, Shirley. She has accomplished many fine things in her life. She has also been at the center of many intractable conflicts in our family. It's common-place to observe that people bring different perspectives to any particular situation. That's as true in families as it is in courtrooms and movies.

In an ideal world, I wish that you had been able to meet with, and have conversation with our mother. Perhaps good things might have come from that, although it’s not our actions so much as Grace that causes such things. 

In this letter, I am trying to create some space for Grace. I wish that we had known about you a long time ago. As it is, I have taken some delight in sharing with many of my friends the surprising -- and by that surprise, a happy -- change that your presence brought into my family. Your late entrance into my awareness has provided yet more evidence for my own conviction that all of us carry around baggage, and that we deal with our baggage in different ways. Some do better than others. All of us -- it is my conviction -- are offered the opportunity of receiving Grace.

The truth is that I would very much like not just to meet you, but to feel like we were a part of a family. In point of fact, one of the fundamental convictions of my own life is that people from all walks of life, and all kinds of communities and nations are a part of the same family. We are all in this together and we depend on one another. I have had exchange students living in my home over the years, and I have embraced them as a treasured part of my family, though they live in foreign lands.

Bill and I knew for years that our mother carried a secret. We both tried to encourage her to share it with us, emphasizing that we loved her no matter what. She chose to take her secret with her, not knowing that it was no longer secret. 

In my youth, I learned much of what I know about love from my mother. I knew from a young age that my mother carried baggage. I saw my mother trying to love others and especially those who were strangers or poor, outcast or rejected. She was a flawed person, like all the rest of us, but she was so much more than her     flaws.

I wish you could’ve met her. But there is still an opportunity for us to expand the horizon of family as we know it. I hope we can find a way to do that.
