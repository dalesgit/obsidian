When President [Biden’s](https://thehill.com/people/biden/) term in the White House began two years ago, it seemed the U.S. had remerged to offer world leadership on climate despite resistance from the Republican Party.
​
To date, U.S. leadership has not eventuated, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently [issued harsh words to the international community](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2023-02-06/secretary-generals-briefing-the-general-assembly-priorities-for-2023-scroll-down-for-bilingual-delivered-all-english-and-all-french-versions) for failing to act. “I have a special message for fossil-fuel producers and their enablers scrambling to expand production and raking in monster profits: If you cannot set a credible course for net-zero, with 2025 and 2030 targets covering all your operations, you should not be in business” and he added “your core product is our core problem.”
​
At a time of massive profits, it is unconscionable that some major oil companies are [reducing their planned reductions in emissions](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3848087-bp-cuts-back-2030-climate-goal/).
​
In Biden’s recent  [State of the Union Address](https://www.voanews.com/a/transcript-president-biden-s-2023-state-of-the-union-address/6953032.html), he extolled the Inflation Reduction Act as “the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.” Yet, new fossil fuel development is being approved in [Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/gulf-of-mexico-alaska-targeted-for-offshore-oil-gas-leasing-in-biden-plan-2022-07-01/).
​
Similarly, in Australia, several massive gas projects are also about to be approved. Yet, both countries need to set an example to others even if modest world emission targets for 2030 are to be achieved.
