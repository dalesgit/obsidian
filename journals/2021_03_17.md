	- Roam-like Notes
	  
	  Today our first party in  year. The Judges first time in another's home. Anniversary of Mary Pat's father's funeral.
	  
	  I made some progress getting comfortable with roam stuff on emacs. Smoother with spacemacs. I totally spaced out Zoom with 101. I've felt dejected for days now.
