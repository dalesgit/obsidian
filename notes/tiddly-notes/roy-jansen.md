# Roy Jansen

Scott Jansen I thought of him tonight. Watching *Outlander*. Dougal announced to Claire that they were leaving in the morning at "new light." I think of Roy:

* early morning leaving
* Before ski areas he skied Loveland pass, with a group who had a designated driver. They'd drive to the top of the pass, everyone else skiing down a path, and the driver driving down to pick them up
* My father may have caused/contributed to his death through his affair with Eunice.
* my children don't have a clue about all this that I carry with me.
