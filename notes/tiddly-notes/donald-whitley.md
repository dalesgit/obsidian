What I Should Have Said At Mom's Funeral, and Kind of Did.

When I was very young, like 5 or 6, my brother and I were poking around this very church, and no one else was around. Back in those days , children were more 'free range' and maybe it was a week day, who knows? In any case, Randy challenged me to come into this very room, and he told me that "God lives in there."

So I plucked up my courage , and my tiny little legs moved me into this awesome, empty space.

I stood and listened very carefully. In that silence, I had no thoughts and only a bit of curiosity and a whisper of fear, because I wasn't sure I was ready to meet the Lord God, King and Creator of the Universe!

There was silence, and as I listened to that silence, I could feel that silence was listening to me!  Opening, opening, opening, into deeper silence. It freaked me out a little bit! My tiny little legs moved me out of this awesome, empty space.

So today we've returned to Mom's home church and I'd like to talk a bit about her spirituality. Throughout her life , she and I were able to discuss all of these things and as we both aged, those conversations became more "Heavy, Deep, and Real." Especially in these last few years,  we talked very explicitly about death, God, Jesus, and the afterlife. I know that not everyone gets the chance to do that.

If it was the case that God is just a metaphor, and Jesus was an example  of morality, and that this material plane is all that exists, and that the soul was like a candle flame that went out went its fuel was exhausted, if that was the case, then Mom would have been comfortable with that. She had resolved all of the things she needed to resolve, her children knew she loved them and they her, and she had done her best she could with the challenges that life gave her. She knew that even if this was all there was, that the fact that the universe exploded in such a way, say 13.5 billion years ago so that stars, planets, people, her parents and she were created at a particular moment in history, this was incredible and miraculous. She didn't take it for granted at all. Everyday existence IS a miracle. That would've been enough.

But Mom was a Christian, and she felt that the soul would move on after death and return to God. She was ready for that, too. We talked about how the soul illuminates the body, like the sun illuminates the stained glass window. The window wakes up one morning all glowing and says, "Hey I'm alive". Then the sun goes down and the window says, "Oh, I must be dying". But the light doesn't die. It returns to its source, and has never really been separate from its source. In prayer, worship, and in her private contemplation, Mom returned, inwardly, to that Supreme Nucleus of Light, the Source, the pure Love. The Christ.

She was very open minded,  and we'd discuss all of these deep questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, other spiritual faiths, universal love, theogeny and theodicy, and whether we could actually conceive of God since God was, by definition, beyond our conception. Aquinas! Plotinus! Kierkegaard! Erasmus!

She was ready to go. She had worn out her body after a lifetime of service and struggle. Her mind began to give out, too, and we'd laugh and cry together as she realized that she wasn't going to be able to rely on that either. She knew she had to let it all go. "You gotta let that go", she used to say. She called my brother once, "I'm just calling you to let you know I'm losing my mind". She thought that was pretty funny.

She had a long, adventurous life, and a peaceful death. She loved so many people, as a kindergarten teacher and as mother and as a member of her spiritual community, the People of Praise. My sister took care of her for many, many years, and I know it wasn't easy. Mom could be cranky, but never cruel. Not every elder gets the chance to live their last years at home,  and I will always be thankful for Christine and her children, Aiden and Eilie, for watching over her.

So, now she has left her tired body behind. We would call it the husk, or the shell, when we'd talk about dying. She was very frail at the end, so she didn't have much to lose! I don't feel much of a sense of loss right now, rather mostly gratitude. I am so thankful that I was able to share this precious life with her, and though the has left the body and mind behind, I still feel her in here, in my heart.

Oh my goodness! This is the most awesome ... and what do I call it? ... it's testimony and a witness, it's a song of awe and wonder, it is a, well, a dance of grace. Thank you Donald. And thank you Carolyn.
