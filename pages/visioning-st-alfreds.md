## Review agenda
- data gathering over the course of the summer
- Routhage church sizes
- **Breakout groups**: fellowship, outreach, formation, worship, pastoral care
	- what hungry for in the areas?
	- one needs to?
	- Big Hairy Audacious Goal?
	- any quick wins?
- Voting a chance to prioritize since we are a small congregation with limited resources
- commit to one of the 5 areas with signature
## Overview of rationale & focus
- contrast a direction of vision from top down
- "What do you to be when you grow up?" vs. a parent/teacher instructing us as to what we are to become.
- listen to each other, listen to our hearts, our collective energy, and the empowerment to make them happen
