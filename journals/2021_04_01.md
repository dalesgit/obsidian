I am so discouraged. See the extensive notes taken in Joplin related to my visit with Linda. The gods were speaking to her today about Dorothy Day. I contributed to that. But I think the gods were speaking to me about misfiring. About missing. About alienation. About communication aborted.

Just so discouraged that there is a path back.
