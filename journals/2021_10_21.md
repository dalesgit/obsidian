	- Yesterday's reflection in *Give Us This Day*. Mary Pat responded that this passage seemed intended for me. She seems focused on my un-settled, dis-ease, loss-of-focus, loss-of-self. I returned to the theme with Linda at Spiritual Direction. (cf. "Joplin" notes)
	  
	  > It was the Lord’s doing, not their own. It was the Lord’s power at work in and for them, which could do immeasurably more than they could ask or imagine (cf. Eph 3:20). It was sheer gift; it was grace.
	  >
	  > So is our deliverance from sin, as St. Paul reminds us in his Letter to the Romans. Of ourselves, we could never have broken the power of sin and death over us, but Jesus has done it for us. We are indeed raised from the dead, even now sharing in his eternal life. Nevertheless, sin continually attempts to ensnare us. On our own, we could never withstand it, but we can with the power of God’s grace. Our help is in the name of the Lord. We need only call upon him.
