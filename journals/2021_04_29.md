	- Session with Linda – See Joplin entry – ended with the admonition: "Do it with contemplative step-by-step. With **non-duality.**
	  
	  Insight from Contemplative Bible Study:
	  
	  1. I am the Vine, God is the Farmer. Is a reminder that it's not about me. God is looking at a garden that is lush, at a vineyard full of vines. And I'm only one among the vines or plants. Pruning is something that is done across the whole garden. It's not about me.
	  1. For the first time as I read the image about pruning, it was a positive thing. From the gardener's perspective, pruning isn't a painful thing at all. It is taking care of the garden. It is nurturing. It is ensuring fruitfulness.
