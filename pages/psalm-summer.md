### Third Sunday after the Epiphany
**Psalm 62:6-14**
*Nonne Deo?*

6 For God alone my soul in **silence waits**; *
truly, my hope is in **him**.

7 He alone is my rock and my sal**vation**, *
my stronghold, so that I shall not be **shaken**.

8 In God is my safety and my **honor**; *
God is my strong rock and my **refuge**.

9 Put your trust in him always, O **people**, *
pour out your hearts before him, for God is our **refuge**.

10 Those of high degree are but a fleeting **breath**, *
even those of low estate cannot be **trusted**.

11 On the scales they are lighter than a **breath**, *
all of them to**gether**.

12 Put no trust in extortion;
in robbery take no empty **pride**; *
though wealth increase, set not your heart u**pon it**.

13 God has spoken once, twice have I **heard it**, *
that power belongs to **God**.

14 Steadfast love is yours, O **Lord**, *
for you repay everyone according to his **deeds**.
