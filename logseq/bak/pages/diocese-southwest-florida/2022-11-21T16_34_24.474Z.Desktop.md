		- Addendum (sent originally to Catherine Massey)
			- When I and my family moved from Indiana to Hawai'i, the canon to the ordinary (now bishop of the diocese) Bob Fitzpatrick, had been aware of the precarious nature of my marriage even as he invited me to do ministry in Hawai'i. We had served and worked together in the diocese of Northern Indiana. By the end of 2010 the marriage had really collapsed and it was also apparent that a ministry move was appropriate for the parish as well as for me.
			- I came away from my 2nd CREDO in 2007 with a determination to find a spiritual director. From that date the relationship proved to be a vital one for me. I was in regular contact with my bishop and my support network as the marriage deteriorated rapidly throughout 2008-2010. I sought to make the best decisions possible for the two children at home, aged 18 and 16. Against my wishes, the response from their mother was to precipitously move out of the house with the two girls in early March of 2011. From that point onward there was no constructive communication between us.
			- As negotiations to secure an equitable divorce agreement proceeded through 2011 and 2012, it became increasingly difficult to find common ground with my estranged wife. During that time I began a romantic relationship with a woman who is now very happily my wife. This drew continued anger from my estranged wife that surprised even the bishop. I remained transparent and honest with him through all the tense emotional times of 2011-2012. My wife made accusations against me that the bishop brought to my attention in the fall of 2011. His judgment in the matter was that the accusation did not rise to the level of conduct unbecoming a priest, but that pastorally I needed to take a step back. Ultimately no action was taken on the complaint, but the bishop and I agreed to a number of pastoral steps that I followed throughout 2013. From January 2014 through the time of my moving from Hawai’i, I supplied as a priest in the diocese.
			- I resigned my position as rector of St. Mary’s effective the summer of 2012, and began my position as an Instructor at Chaminade University. My retirement with the Church Pension Fund began as of January 2013. My wife accepted a tenure track position at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC, beginning in the fall of 2014.
			- I have been licensed since my move to the mainland in the diocese of Upper South Carolina and North Carolina. I supplied in many different parishes and had particularly close relationships with 2 small congregations. I served as an Interim Rector at St. Paul's, Monroe, NC from August 2021-April 2022.
