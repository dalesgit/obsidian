I was so intrigued that I ordered a used copy of her journals and letters, *Pure Heart; Enlightened Mind.* When it arrived this evening, as I pulled it out of its wrapper, it fell open to a page. In the middle of the page I read:

"Do you like jazz?" said Tessan-san. "Yes," said I, while thinking to myself, I'd like Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snot it uncannily was. Often, with very simple things like that, I think of something I want and it just comes. Strange.
