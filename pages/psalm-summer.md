**Psalm 50:1-6**
*Deus deorum*

1 The Lord, the God of gods, has **spoken**; *
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its **setting**.

2 Out of Zion, perfect in its **beauty**, *
God reveals himself in **glory**.

3 Our God will come and will not keep **silence**; *
before him there is a consuming flame,
and round about him a raging **storm**.
