### Psalm 48

*Magnus Dominus*

1 Great is the Lord, and highly to be **praised**; *  
in the city of our God is his holy hill.

2 Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the hill of Zion, *  
the very center of the world and the city of the great King.

3 God is in her citadels; *  
he is known to be her sure refuge.

4 Behold, the kings of the earth assembled *  
and marched forward together.

5 They looked and were astounded; *  
they retreated and fled in terror.

6 Trembling seized them there; *  
they writhed like a woman in childbirth,  
like ships of the sea when the east wind shatters them.

7 As we have heard, so have we seen,  
in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God; *  
God has established her for ever.

8 We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O God, *  
in the midst of your temple.

9 Your praise, like your Name, O God, reaches to the world's end; *  
your right hand is full of justice.

10 Let Mount Zion be glad  
and the cities of Judah rejoice, *  
because of your judgments.

11 Make the circuit of Zion;  
walk round about her; *  
count the number of her towers.

12 Consider well her bulwarks;  
examine her strongholds; *  
that you may tell those who come after.s

13 This God is our God for ever and ever; *  
he shall be our guide for evermore.
