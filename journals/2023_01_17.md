#reflection In my sleep I was beginning to compose sooner verse. I tried to find images to begin talking about the cruise, the people on the cruise, the culture, the world collapsing around these folks who are coasting. 

The article about salary above is related. These are not indolent rich. They’re too middle class for that. And it is I. C’est moi. People with T-shirt’s of concert tours. Here they collect cruises. And I thought a shirt with our ports would approach in a small way how I feel about my cruise. Collecting. Saying you’ve done it. What am I doing actually? Not much really. Floating hotel. We’re not so different from the colossal armadas of floating fishing vessels/factories. 

I said the other day to Mary Pat that I didn’t know if I could write a sermon any more. She could really hear it. At least I’m rusty.
