# Linda Serepca

1/11

Linda,
Thank you sincerely for sharing with me the materials via email. Mostly "Epiphany discernment" related and the discussion about the Epiphany riot/coup/uprising. I was likewise impressed by the response of my diocesan bishop in Hawai'i – the first positive thing about him I've said in quite some time.

It is the "Lost is a place" material that I am especially grateful for. I resonate with the Epiphany process, with the template for discernment that it communicates, with the "narrative" structure of the guide. I specifically asked you early on for help with Ignatian insights and this seems to be one such. Thank you. I have done a quick run through of the cycle for myself, recognizing past journeys I've taken, but trying to focus on the "lost is a place" place where I seem to be now.

The loss I feel with re. my two lost daughters is the deepest grief as I look at them at this moment. The guide you have shared with me provided a glimmer or reflection, at least, of light and purpose and offering, to come. It is a journey. And as you have emphasized – I am here.

Shalom,
Dale
