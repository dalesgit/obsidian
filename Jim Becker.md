I observed that he is the super-parent in their household. Susie seems flakey. The girls both look to him with awe-filled, adoring eyes. He did almost all the cooking while we were there. He also did all the clean-up. He financially provides very niecely for the family. He is spiritually alive and inquisitive -- witness his major role in Lizzie's confirmation preparation. 

(By the way, Lizzie's beautiful note of farewell and the tears in her eyes as we said "Good-bye") was all so poignant. I love her.
