## To [Emma](Emma)
*In the past I have been defensive, inquiring, attempting to engage. Now is the time to find the positive and just express it.*

In the past I didn't know how to appreciate [[Miriam]]'s response to me that went along the lines of, "Emma is doing fine. She's happy. That's what you want as a father, isn't it?" **What was it that I wanted as a father? What were my goals in 1991? 1992? 1994? 2011?**

- The example of love between a couple that their mother and I exemplified was dysfunctional and toxic. I wanted them to know that there were alternatives.
- It is without a doubt that [Lydia](Lydia.md) and [Emma](Emma) were the primary reasons I was alive. Their well-being was my number one goal in life. For them, I would clearly have died if it would give them life.
## [What is love](What%20is%20love.md) , then?
- They came with me to Miriam's graduation -- driving all through the night.
- Their mother chose a separate life early on -- one in which I was not invited. She chose the vacations at which I was not a part. She chose to develop the memories apart from me -- when Emma was still a "single-digit". **Love is not that**.
