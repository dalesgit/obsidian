- his scholarly references are not ground-breaking but covering the whole range of the development of New Testament scholarship.
- He is trying to speak to the scholarly challenge of bridging the epochs:
	- pre-critical
	- Enlightenment historical
	- historical-critical
	- post-modern

For him the way to do that is through the primacy of "story" -- but understood in such a way it doesn't produce [[relativism]].

- enlightenment: either/or
- post-enlightenment rationalism
- anti-enlightenment supernaturalism
- importance of history while recognizing historical description by itself is incomplete
