### Psalm 45:1-2, 7-10

*Eructavit cor meum*

1 My heart is stirring with a noble song;  
let me recite what I have fashioned for the **king**; \*  
my tongue shall be the pen of a skilled **writer**.

2 You are the fairest of **men**; \*  
grace flows from your lips,  
because God has blessed you for **ever**.

7 Your throne, O God, endures for ever and **ever**, \*  
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom;  
you love righteousness and hate in**iquity**.

8 Therefore God, your God, has a**nointed you** \*  
with the oil of gladness above your **fellows**.

9 All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and **cassia**, \*

10 Kings' daughters stand among the ladies of the **court**; \*  
on your right hand is the queen,  
adorned with the gold of **Ophir**.
