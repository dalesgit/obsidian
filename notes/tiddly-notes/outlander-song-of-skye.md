# Outlander Song of Skye

We're happy to present every word below, so you can learn them all by heart:

Sing me a song of a lass that is gone,\
Say, could that lass be I?\
Merry of soul she sailed on a day\
Over the sea to Skye.\
\
Billow and breeze, islands and seas,\
Mountains of rain and sun,\
All that was good, all that was fair,\
All that was me is gone.\
\
Sing me a song of a lass that is gone,\
Say, could that lass be I?\
Merry of soul she sailed on a day\
Over the sea to Skye
