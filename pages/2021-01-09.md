Yesterday Linda emailed me material mentioned from our session on Thursday. It started with her quoting "someone" "Lost is a place, too."

Today I got an email from Peter asking me for the 2nd time what I wanted to teach in the fall. I settled on 101 and 220, 2 sections of 101 if they were online.

Learned from Facebook that Lydia spent Christmas in Hawai'i with her beau. It was painful to find out, even as I was glad for her happiness and that she got to be by the ocean. I note that she also lives near Lake Michigan. It is I who is land-locked.
