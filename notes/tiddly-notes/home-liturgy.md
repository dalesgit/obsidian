# HomeLiturgy

## Ash Wednesday

## Maundy Thursday

* 1 goal is the preparation: gather bowl (plastic, fancy, plain: possible gift from congregation of plastic bowl) , pitcher (ditto re. bowl) , towel,  bread (muffin, biscuit, slide of bread; whatever you have), cup (water, wine, juice? whatever gives you a sense of nourishment)
* after the gospel reading, pour water over hands of another at table, feed and drink to one another. If you are alone, be mindful of one to whom you are or have been connected â€“ as you reverently wash your own hands, take some bread and wine.

There are some examples, from past years as well as contemporary, pandemic-sensitive ones.

e.g. [aleteia](https://aleteia.org/2020/04/07/heres-how-to-celebrate-holy-thursday-at-home/) and [Jesuits](https://thejesuitpost.org/2020/04/a-guide-to-celebrating-the-easter-triduum-at-home/)

Others:

an ["Anglican take](https://www.churchrez.org/holy-week-at-home/maundy-thursday/#forkids)

My instinct is KISS.

## Good Friday

* gift of congregation of small cross
* abbreviated liturgy
* guided prayer

Good Friday
