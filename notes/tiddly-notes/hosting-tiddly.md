WorkingWithTiddly

[This site](https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-static-website-generator) explains in detail the process of using TW to create a static site â€“ n.b. I didn't do all the steps when I was using github to save my Tiddly for WU class site. I have just adlibbed my own site after learning that I can link my hosted page to other repositories. The last part was the important part.

The steps lead to a static site working like a Tiddly I think.
