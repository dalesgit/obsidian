		- Oh, Ali,
		  This is like one of the most wonderful emails I've ever received. Your trust and honesty in sharing something of your story is a treasure and I thank you profoundly.
		  
		  In terms of your conclusions about things, I mostly agree with all of them. Your stubbornness and not fitting in – yep, check that. From the sounds of it I would say you have earned your conclusions in spades. Over the years I have watched my little brother be a model for me of a loving, kind, and thoughtful person. He's also either atheist or agnostic. He loves me and I love him. I've tried to generalize over the years, thinking at times that unbelievers are better at love than Christians. But I don't really think that's the case. I've known Christians who are profoundly loving and kind also. It's also clearly the case that Christians don't have a monopoly on violence, prejudice, and evil. At this point in my life I've decided I'm content to continue to try to be kind and love and to be a witness and force against violence, prejudice and evil. As long as the Christians accept me I'm good with that. At this point I don't think there's any other place for me.
		  
		  I heard an interview with Pete Seeger many years ago. He reflected on how most of the causes that he had stood up for and fought during his long life had ultimately been losing battles. He said that what was important to him was not the winning or losing but to have spent your life with the "good people" – by which he meant the people who were fighting for and against the right things. Love, kindness, against violence, injustice etc., that sort of thing. I sometimes remind myself of his words when I feel discouraged. Your story encourages me. When I see you in church it brings me a smile. Thank you.
		  
		  Faithfully,
		  Dale +

	  Did you know some people call *The Book Of The Dead*
	  
	  **The Book Of Coming Forth Into Light?**
	  
	  That's beautiful.
	  
	  Oh look, I love this part.
	  
	  ---
	  
	  Mayest thou be at peace with me.  \
	  May I advance upon the earth.  \
	  May I crush the evil one.  \
	  May my arms become spears to thwart crocodiles.  \
	  May I live in the season of revolution.  \
	  May the light of my soul detect shadows of evil.  \
	  The doors of perception open.  \
	  Hey!  \
	  What was hidden has been revealed.  \
	  I am restless.  \
	  I smell a change coming.  \
	  The shape of truth is coming.  \
	  Let me fly to the far edge of sky.  \
	  Let me rest in the folds of the earth.  \
	  I am a child of eternity.

	  This is the ending to movie *Radium Girls*
	  
	  The sisters had been fascinated by the Book of the Dead. This lines at the end (quoted above) seem to be in part taken from the opening of the Egyptian book of the dead.
	  
	  The **doors of perception** was what caught my attention. It is, first and foremost for me, from Aldous Huxley – cf. college days, and his experiments with **mescalin**. In reading about that I paid attention to the note that he suffered from **iritis** for many years.
	  
	  The metaphor itself is from William Blake.
	  
	  “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”

	  Yesterday's reflection in *Give Us This Day*. Mary Pat responded that this passage seemed intended for me. She seems focused on my un-settled, dis-ease, loss-of-focus, loss-of-self. I returned to the theme with Linda at Spiritual Direction. (cf. "Joplin" notes)
	  
	  > It was the Lord’s doing, not their own. It was the Lord’s power at work in and for them, which could do immeasurably more than they could ask or imagine (cf. Eph 3:20). It was sheer gift; it was grace.
	  >
	  > So is our deliverance from sin, as St. Paul reminds us in his Letter to the Romans. Of ourselves, we could never have broken the power of sin and death over us, but Jesus has done it for us. We are indeed raised from the dead, even now sharing in his eternal life. Nevertheless, sin continually attempts to ensnare us. On our own, we could never withstand it, but we can with the power of God’s grace. Our help is in the name of the Lord. We need only call upon him.

		- ## Maura O’Halloran
		  
		  *Christian Zen Monk (1955–1982)*
		  
		  Maura O’Halloran, who was born in Boston and raised in Ireland in a large Catholic family, displayed from a young age a deep compassion for human suffering. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, she worked in soup kitchens and traveled widely in Latin America. Her concern for social justice was accompanied by a serious attraction to the spiritual life. After experimenting with various methods of prayer, she decided to explore the wisdom of the East.
		  
		  In 1979 she flew to Japan and applied for admission to a Zen Buddhist monastery in Tokyo, at the time rather a novelty for a woman in a very male setting. Her journals record her experience—sustained periods of meditation, manual labor, and an ascetic discipline of mind and body. After six months she experienced an ecstatic breakthrough, which her Master recognized as enlightenment. So impressed was he by her progress that he made an extraordinary offer—to entrust his monastery to her. But Maura did not believe this was her vocation. “I’m twenty-six and I feel as if I’ve lived my life,” she wrote. “Strange sensation, almost as if I’m close to death. . . . I’m totally content. Of course I want to get deeper, see clearer. . . . If I have another fifty or sixty years (who knows?) of time, I want to live it for other people.”
		  
		  After leaving the monastery she was killed in a bus accident on October 22, 1982. The publication of her journal brought a devoted following by both Christians and Buddhists. A small statue of her in the monastery in Japan is revered by many pilgrims.
		  
		  “*Suddenly I understood that we must take care of things just because they exist.*”—Maura O’Halloran

	  A week ago we learned about Maura O'Halloran at our daily prayer from *Give us this day.* She was a "Christian Zen Monk" who died prematurely and too young. I was so intrigued that I ordered a used copy of her journals and letters, *Pure Heart; Enlightened Mind.* When it arrived this evening, as I pulled it out of its wrapper, it fell open to a page. In the middle of the page I read:
	  
	  > "I made banana pudding. Tessan-san said, "What, no cake?" I pointed out the absence of an oven. The closest we could come was "hot cakey mix." He made a plump, delicious, greasy donuts. ... "Do you like jazz?" said Tessan-san. "Yes," said I, while thinking to myself, I'd like Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snot it uncannily was. Often, with very simple things like that, I think of something I want and it just comes. Strange.

	  Dear Emma,
	  
	  Would that there were words. Enough of them. The select right ones for the job. The job to reflect the loss of what never was. Of dreams? Perhaps. The last birthday gift I remember giving you was a kite ride above Honolulu waters. I don't know if you ever cashed it in. So many years now, I guess it doesn't matter. If there's a dream, now, I suppose it is that before I die you might walk into my room. So much gone.
	  
	  Hau'oli la hanau. Shalom, my beautiful girl. So bright and full of life.
	  
	  Dad

	  *Beyond Self: The False Self vs. the True Self*
	  
	  Thomas Merton claims that "the superficial 'I' is not our real self," but only our "individuality" and "empirical self," not the "hidden and mysterious person in whom we subsist before the eyes of God."20Thomas Merton, /New Seeds of Contemplation/ (Abbey of Gethsemani, Inc., 1961), This kind of thinking is found also in Keating and Pennington.
	  
	  Keating states that CP takes us to a place:
	  
	  "...in which the knower, the knowing, and that which is known are all one. Awareness alone remains. The one who is aware disappears along with whatever was the object of consciousness. This is what divine union is."21Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's
	  Monastery, 1992), 74
	  
	  
	  Keating and Merton both discuss the false self and the true self.  Keating capitalizes "Self," and states:
	  
	  "God and our true Self are not separate. Though we are not God, God and our true Self are the same thing."22Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open
	  Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's Monastery, 1992), 127 According to Merton, our "external, everyday self" is mostly a "fabrication" and is not "our true self" which:
	  
	  "is not easy to find. It is hidden in obscurity and 'nothingness,' at the center, where we are in direct dependence on God."23Thomas Merton, /Contemplative Prayer/ (The Merton Legacy Trust, 1969; Garden City, NY: Image Books Edition, Division of Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971), 70
	  
	  Buddhism teaches that our identities are merely fleeting images or impressions, like images on film, or a "sequence of happenings, of processes,"24Joseph Goldstein, "Exercise/ Easting" in Jean Smith, ed., /Breath Sweeps Mind: A First Guide to Meditation Practice/ (NY: Riverhead Books, 1998), 184

	  Blessed Among Us
	  
	  Gordon Zahn
	  
	  Peacemaker (1918–2007)
	  
	  Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Gordon Zahn was in most respects a traditional Catholic—except in his inability to reconcile the teachings of Christ with orders to kill his fellow humans. In 1942 he declared himself a conscientious objector, though no priest or bishop would support his stand. He was assigned to a work camp for Catholic conscientious objectors, supported by the *Catholic Worker*. Afterward he had trouble finding a Catholic college that would accept him. Nevertheless, he earned a doctorate in sociology and taught at several universities.
	  
	  In 1963 his book *German Catholics and Hitler’s Wars* showed how Germany’s bishops, through their general exhortations of loyal obedience to authority, had become instruments of Nazi power. This was followed by In *Solitary Witness*, which recovered the lost story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian peasant executed for his refusal to serve in Hitler’s army. Zahn’s work, including his personal lobbying, was influential in moving the Council Fathers at Vatican II to support recognition of the right of conscientious objection.
	  
	  Zahn worked tirelessly in the cause for peace, helping to found *Pax Christi USA*. In later years he suffered from Alzheimer’s—and thus was unable to recognize the significance of an invitation in October 2007 to attend the beatification of Franz Jägerstätter. He died two months later on December 9.
	  
	  “*All Christians, whether they realize it or not, have that vocation (in the full religious sense) of serving the cause of peace and, by logical extension, the obligation to oppose war.*”
	  
	  —Gordon Zahn

	  [[Journal] sending me an excerpt from *Naked Now* by Richard Rohr
	  
	  Thank you for this! Not only do I recognize this in connection with yesterday's conversation but I recognize it in my own life. The telling thing for me of what you said was, "There is no 'goal' (in spiritual direction), but if there was one, this is what it would be." Part of what is important in the relationship with Mary Pat is her memory of the teaching her priest gave her as she was discerning her own move to Hawai'i. The priest suggested the possibility that there wasn't a task to do there, but only "to be." As I have heard more than once, perhaps from Richard Rohr, that the goal is to accept that we are loved. There is, of course, a long tradition of seeing the goal as some kind of unity with God. In the counter-cultural ways of my college years, I persuaded a German professor to let me complete my language requirement with an independent study of Meister Eckhart. I did the same with one of my English requirements with an independent study of 14th c. English Mystics – that involved one of my tenderest memories of my father where he helped me photocopy an inter-library loan of the Cloud of Unknowing. The block plan at Colorado College allowed me to take a course in "Christian Mysticism" in the Wind River Range of Wyoming. A lot of this trajectory was influenced by memorizing large quantities of W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot. Most people would say, "What are you thinking?" It made sense to me then and is an important confirmation/memory now. Thanks.
