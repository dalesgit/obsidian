messages from video discussion re. EpiphanyCoupAttempt takeover

Nathan Autry
​Thank you for covering this

America - The Jesuit Review
​Yes!

Edith Bird
​I am glad to see this. Living in SE Missouri, the local diocesan newspaper has refused for months to print letters to the editor that criticize President Trump and his attempt to steal this election.

​if we bring character into this discussion, both candidates would be disqualified. an abortionist isn't a person of good character

​Thank you, Fr. Bryan, for continuing to be a model of prophetic witness for me.

​The American clergy has not been in step with the last three popes who have often spoke about issues that our clergy sidestep. May this be a wake up call. Let’s hear it from the local parish pulpit.

​Read Fr. Massingale's article here: <https://www.americamagazine.org/polit>...

​Thank you for encouraging us all to speak the truth in the presence of injustice, no matter if it offends.
Megan Wilson-Reitz
​Yes! The sin of racism is also corrosive to our Church and it has contributed to the Church's complicity with the worst excesses of the Trump administration.

​Yes Susan no more fear. We must be honest as Fr. Bryan talks about.

Elizabeth Kuhn
​I think many Catholic Trump voters would see yesterday's attack as something "other" – they are not those rioters – back to all racism is just personal bias. Thoughts?
