	  Watching *Les Miserables*. It has to be with Sean. I dislike it so. He wants to do it like me. I just want him gone. But the power of Victor Hugo is so much greater than I. 2 million at his funeral.
	  
	  Anne Hathaway singing "I have a dream" \
	  could be placed beside\
	  Lady Gaga singing "Shallow"
	  
	  [I have a dream ](https://youtu.be/WzNVmZfNoa8)
	  
	  [Shallow ](https://youtu.be/bo_efYhYU2A)
	  
	  or
	  
	  Hugh Jackman's "Who am I?"
	  
	  [Who am I ](https://youtu.be/y7-ZoOUfKv8)
	  
	  My deepest identity is buried in these songs.
	  
	  and Eddie Redmayn "Red and Black song"
	  
	  [Red and Black ](https://youtu.be/cjp-Gyo5tNM) and [Again ](https://youtu.be/oBn1UHtYP9Q)
	  
	  The agony for me is I guess centered on the fathering fathers of Jean Valjean â€“ His love is that of a father who has known redemption.
