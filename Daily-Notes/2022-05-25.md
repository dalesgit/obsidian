Dinner with Robert & Gail. I ended up sharing the power of the video generated t Lancaster's *Christ Church*. Also the importance of *Shema* passing on of the reality of our call

- digitized the bulk of my slides.

Earlier I had had an insight about what gives me satisfaction. I felt satisfied by completing the digitizing process. A bit of nostalgia. I showed Robert & Gail the man who offered me my first drink.

This morning I have spent several hours getting the script to working on the Asus Chromebook to automate setting up rclone with 3 different services and getting the backup to work.

It is the [[problem solving]] that is satisfying.
