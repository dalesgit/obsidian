# acceptable time

## Reflection

**Each Smile, Each Song**

One of my favorite new acquaintances is the infant whom I babysit. The first day I spent with her, she was four months old. I rocked her, fed her, and sang lullabies to soothe her. I was nearly paralyzed by the weight of each moment spent with her. Each action was accompanied by the thought: *I am teaching this child what the world looks like.*

Not that she will remember any of those moments. My actions will be lost in the building blocks of her consciousness. But each smile, each song taught her what the world would look like.

Her conception of the world depends on how the adults around her—including me—treat her, just as my first impressions of the world developed from the adults who first surrounded me.

Is the world kind? Can I trust you? Am I loved? Our hearts pose these questions every day. Babies embody these questions in their purest form. And they draw out of us answers that foster a gentler world.

Christ’s command to turn the other cheek resonates with Paul’s call to action, “now is a very acceptable time.” The world—including the next generation of humans—is made of our actions. We, and we alone, are the ones responsible for making the world gentle, kind, and good.

Now—today—is a very acceptable time to smile rather than scold, to replace vengeance with love, to re-create the world more gently.
