3. Our climate history trapped in the ice
4. Antarctica is changing
5. Closing off the ozone hole and hope for the future

# notes
- We didn't know what was under ice sheet 50 years ago
- Ice CA. 3 km deep
- Network of lakes and rivers. Weird. Pressure and geothermal heat.
- Lake Vostok has tides. 
- Russians 40 years of ice core. 30 years drilling. Potentially 14 million years isolated from rest off earth. Desire not to contaminate the lake. Eg intrude 100s gallons kerosene to lubricate. Russians did itt anyway
- Thousands off species of mostly bacteria. Contamination evident. 
- 70% off Chilean sea bass depleted
- Mosses that can hibernate for many years. Bio prospecting. Complete ban on mining. 
- Over long periods of time the tilt of earth and shape of orbit all change. Thus 100 mill year cycles
- Go back 3 mill years ago since co2 at today's levels
