	  Tonight at dinner with Charlotte and Henry, I told stories:
	  
	  1. The principle of keeping church safe, is not easy and simple. But having a principle in mind allows for ... ? progress? There is the episode of Bridget's son and the Sr. Warden's daughter. But tellable story is of homeless person, mentally ill, her partner my drummer, she loved the liturgy. But she attacked Jane Oki. She was no longer welcome.
	  1. the ease of body in saying "no" to WU. But in contrast there have been times when I am defensive and my body reacts to precisely the thing I need to do but have resisted.
	  1. Lilly ?? and Elaine ?? suggested as Warden types. Scott, perhaps, as vestry. I asked the question who should recruit? Not clear.
	  1. Could we have a warden who refuses vaccine? I think, "No."
