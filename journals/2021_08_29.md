	  From my prayers tonight, world prayers
	  
	  Thanks
	  
	  BY W. S. MERWIN
	  
	  with the night falling we are saying thank you
	  we are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings
	  we are running out of the glass rooms
	  with our mouths full of food to look at the sky
	  and say thank you
	  we are standing by the water thanking it
	  standing by the windows looking out
	  in our directions
	  
	  back from a series of hospitals back from a mugging
	  after funerals we are saying thank you
	  after the news of the dead
	  whether or not we knew them we are saying thank you
	  
	  over telephones we are saying thank you
	  in doorways and in the backs of cars and in elevators
	  remembering wars and the police at the door
	  and the beatings on stairs we are saying thank you
	  in the banks we are saying thank you
	  in the faces of the officials and the rich
	  and of all who will never change
	  we go on saying thank you thank you
	  
	  with the animals dying around us
	  taking our feelings we are saying thank you
	  with the forests falling faster than the minutes
	  of our lives we are saying thank you
	  with the words going out like cells of a brain
	  with the cities growing over us
	  we are saying thank you faster and faster
	  with nobody listening we are saying thank you
	  thank you we are saying and waving
	  dark though it is
