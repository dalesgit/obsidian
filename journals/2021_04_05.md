	  Today I pulled out Mom's knit afghan, intending to fix it or get it fixed. And to give it, I think, to Miriam. But maybe Lydia?
	  
	  Tonight I saw the space station make its transit across the sky. In the back yard from just above the fence to disappearing in the clouds of the eastern sky. Mary Pat wanted to include and be with Sean.
	  
	  Meeting with the WU department, Takita mistakenly described me as having a "terminal degree", and so qualified. Peter reiterated that I was qualified to teach the courses, as if he was trying to camouflage that I didn't have that degree. The department has depended on me adding to their statistics for the University. They are so small and weak.
	  
	  I got so much working on the faces of the 2 computers that failed on me last week. I recognized that's why I missed some emails.
	  
	  That, and I had some success with trying to preach Easter.
	  
	  Julian and Lydia have called to thank us for the money. Miriam, I think may not recognize it yet, for whatever reason.
	  
	  In reflecting with Mary Pat on the Department's being in an Interim interim position and jockeying for where it's headed, noting that I am important to them, I said they have no purchase on me, no leverage with me. I can say, "No thanks at any time."
