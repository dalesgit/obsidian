	- ## Insight:
	  
	  Mary Pat has had an interest in maintaining that the issue between us was Sean. Going back at least to the time during prayer when she asked me when I was going to forgive Sean. As long as she maintains that I "hate" Sean, she has the high road to an impregnable case against me. But she has also been the one to argue that the conflict between us pre-dates Sean so that it isn't "Sean's fault."
	  
	  Strange bedfellows or some such metaphor.
	- ## Further broken trust:
	  
	  I have wondered over the past day about the money we had agreed that Sean would pay for room and board. I asked where the money was. She responded that he hasn't paid anything – she wanted to launch into a self-justification that he had wanted to pay cash but she didn't want that  – but I cut her off, saying I just wanted information.
	  
	  It should be something like $5,000.00. But my only serious request has been ignored.
