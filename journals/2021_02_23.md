	  She had her doctor talk to my doctor about my "depression." She was afraid to say anything because she "knew how made I would be." The offense of that is beyond my saying.
	  
	  She repeats that I forbid Sean from taking out the trash. That is such a twisted untruth. But she repeats it like it is. I offended her mother's funeral because I conveyed my unhappiness – anger – at Katy for refuses the gift I had brought to Dayton. As if that was the sum total of my effort to minister to her at the time of her mother's death. **It's like a repeat of Bridget**.
	  
	  Fuck it.
	  
	  When her family asked her about my "depression" or whatever it is, did she tell them that she had repeatedly walked out on the marriage? That she had repeatedly shared with her friends and counselors a litany of all the things that are wrong with me? That she had repeatedly said that she was done with the marriage? Did she tell them about what an albatross Sean's presence is? About how I have repeatedly said that it is a big problem for me and she has repeatedly made it clear that she doesn't give a shit?
	  
	  No, I didn't think so.
