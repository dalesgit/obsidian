## Birth and more
When you were conceived it was a little like you were first born. There was joy in the house that's for sure.

There at the very beginning of your life there was one thing that stands out for me. Of all of my children you are the only one that I didn't have the opportunity of being present at the moment you emerged. They put the knife to your mother’s belly, having given her a nerve block, and she twitched and pulled back. Immediately they knew they had to do a cesarean and they removed me from the delivery room, although I objected at the time. Someone explained to me that medical team couldn't have the possibility of a father fainting or some other reaction when they had to give their full attention to the mother and her child. I totally accepted that, although I knew that my own personality wouldn't have succumbed. In fact, when faced with all manner of crises, my tendency is to face it with a calm demeanor that seeks to deal with whatever is at hand.

Even before we got home I acted as a kind of La Leche League coach. I wanted you to be nursed because I had seen the benefits of that for the three older children. Your mother hadn't done very much with nursing.

I remember reading stories to you from an early age, before you were able even to comprehend them. I remember rocking you until you fell asleep in my arms. That gave me a satisfaction and joy that it is really impossible to describe.
## Michigan City
As you grew into a toddler, I remember the delight we both felt as we went out to the front yard, knelt down and crawled around looking at all the living creatures.

Partly because we have photographs depicting you and your sister lying contentedly in the mountains of autumn leaves, I can remember you playing in the yard, swinging on the swings, running to play games with the next-door neighbors. I remember when you wanted to have a party and invited your friends from kindergarten. There were one or two who were people of color, but you didn't see color do you only saw friends. That's a characteristic of you that I have treasured and never lost sight.

Again I have one or two photographs when I have company due to a father daughter dance. I was so excited for you and thought you were the loveliest child in the room. There was probably a part of me that was sad because I missed those opportunities with your older sister Miriam. But this time around I missed the chance to dance with you. You were embarrassed to be with me, or maybe you were afraid that you didn't know how to dance. I don't know what it was but I do think I was the proudest father in the room.

filming her concert at Kindergarten. So proud of her.
Passion for water -Lake Michigan in the cold May weather. Dislocating shoulder when we were jumping in the waves. I felt so bad -and left out of the healing as Bridget took her without me to hospital.
## Move to Hawai’i
Singing Potters song as we drove to Hawai’i. Her sadness at leaving e.g. her substitute family, Ethan, Mama Sue.
Swimming in the pool at Hawai’i Kai.
Playing in the snow on top of Pikes Peak.
Connected with her 3rd grade teacher at Kamilo’iki. Special focus on writing -Lydia knew about telling stories.
Learning to swim -passion for water.
## Priory
Driving to school -“pastor’s kid knows homeless names”
Picking up the Kia and she drove for the first time. Going to the center and waiting for hours to take the exam and get the permit.
## Church related
Assisting me at Isaiah’s baptism (in the rain)
I felt so proud of her.
But there on Maui I felt sad that again she wanted me to be gone.
Was she intimidated by me?
So angry with me?
Her counseling uncovered her anger at me -and this was before the divorce
Leen dancing at her graduation ceremonies
## Move to South Bend
She kept me out of the loop in choosing a school.
Somehow I got the message from the priest on Kaua’i (spiritual director for Happening?) that a parent should pay for whatever school the child chooses
Glad that she was associated with my alma mater. Disappointed that she was going to be around the old cronies and family of Bridget.
# Post-Divorce
Desire for connection.
