	- The conversation:
	  
	  MP seems to be distant. She acknowledged that she had a long and good conversation with Sean last night. She said nothing more about that.
	  
	  Huge arenas cut off from between us.
	  
	  She pursued my talking about how for me talking long-distance to my children has been ambivalent. How it is painful for me to see Miriam with Bridget and Emma. How Owen pointed out to me as a 12 year old that I was triangulating him with his mother.
	  
	  She asked, "Where would you move if I died?" Answers included: Arizona, Hawaii, Colorado, Northwest. Each of them problematic. But I said certainly not Florida. I reversed the question and she said that certainly she would end up in Florida. But there are advantages to being here.
	  
	  I guess it felt like she had pursued more realistically than I the possibility of going on without me. She said, "Thank you for conversation." I acknowledged but it doesn't feel very good right now.
