- # Birth and more
	- pain when the knife put to Bridget's belly. I was thrown out of delivery room -- she's the only one of five.
		- giving my best to coach and encourage Bridget in nursing. Wanting the best for Lydia. *La Leche League with Mo*
	- reading stories. She loved them.
	- holding her til she fell asleep
- # Michigan City
	- Kneeling in the grass to see living things.
	- Flopping in the mountains of leaves.
	- Father/Daughter dance. So proud. Thought her so beautiful. Disappointed that she was too shy or embarrassed to be with me, she wouldn't dance.
	- filming her concert at Kindergarten. So proud of her.
	- Passion for water -- Lake Michigan in the cold May weather. Dislocating shoulder when we were jumping in the waves. I felt so bad -- and left out of the healing as Bridget took her without me to hospital.
- # Move to Hawai'i
	- Singing Potters song as we drove to Hawai'i. Her sadness at leaving e.g. her substitute family, Ethan, Mama Sue.
	- Swimming in the pool at Hawai'i Kai.
	- Playing in the snow on top of Pikes Peak.
	- Connected with her 3rd grade teacher at Kamilo'iki. Special focus on writing -- Lydia knew about telling stories.
	- Learning to swim -- passion for water.
- # Priory
	- Driving to school -- "pastor's kid knows homeless names"
	- Assisting me at Isaiah's baptism (in the rain)
	- Picking up the Kia and she drove for the first time. Going to the center and waiting for hours to take the exam and get the permit.
- # Leadership in Happening
	- I felt so proud of her.
	- But there on Maui I felt sad that again she wanted me to be gone.
		- Was she intimidated by me?
		- So angry with me?
		- Her counseling uncovered her anger at me -- and this was before the divorce
		- Leen dancing at her graduation ceremonies
- # Move to South Bend
	- She kept me out of the loop in choosing a school.
	- Somehow I got the message from the priest on Kaua'i (spiritual director for Happening?) that a parent should pay for whatever school the child chooses
	- Glad that she was associated with my alma mater. Disappointed that she was going to be around the old cronies and family of Bridget.
- # Post-Divorce
	- Desire for connection.
