## Gratitude
- Yesterday looking for the extraordinary in the ordinary. 
	1. Walking the neighborhood to hand out loaves of bread that MP had made. The 2<sup>nd</sup> stop had a young man outside in the frigid air. Maybe he had been smoking. Maybe just drinking coffee. I asked if it was OK to leave the bread with him. As he responded with his "yes" he said something about the hospital. He saw that I was a neighbor and assumed that I knew about whoever was in the hospital. I didn't. I said, "Tell me about the hospital." 
	   He went on to talk about his father having had an implanted de-fibrillator or pacemaker? and something went wrong. He was returned to the hospital in ICU but now he was preparing to come home.
	   I touched a life and he felt heard. I was blessed.
	2. The exquisite rendition of the the "Night of silence" / "Silent night" overlay at church.

Song by David Haas

Cold are the people, winter of life
We tremble in shadows this cold endless night
Frozen in the snow lie roses sleeping
Flowers that will echo the sunrise
Fire of hope is our only warmth
Weary, it's flame will be dying soon.

Voice in the distance, call in the night
On wind you enfold us You speak of the light
Gentle on the ear you whisper softly
Rumours of a dawn so embracing
Breathless love awaits darkened souls
Soon will we know of the morning.

Spirit among us, shine like the star
Your light that guides shepherds and kings from afar
Shimmer in the sky so empty, lonely
Rising in the warmth of your son's love
Star unknowing of night and day
Spirit we wait for your loving Son.

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace.
