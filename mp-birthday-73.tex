Oh, the places we've been. The wonder. The awe.\\
Beyond imagining. Maybe yours as well\\
It should be \textbf{awesome} for one and all\\
To pass this way but once,\\
no practice, no do-overs, this one time\\
to make a song from chance and chaos, mis-direction and purpose,\\
This song of grace.

\begin{quote}
``This is my song, O God of all the nations,\\
a song of peace for lands afar and mine;\\
this is my home, the country where my heart is;\\
here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine:\\
but other hearts in other lands are beating\\
with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.''{[}\^{}1{]} {[}\^{}1{]}: Lloyd Stone
\end{quote}

You've been through this year\\
The 72nd cycle, a remarkable number,\\
The atomic number of \emph{hafnium},\\
``room temperature'',\\
The number of translators of the \emph{Septuagint},\\
The number sent by Jesus in Luke 10,\\
Par for 18 holes of golf.\\
And we've made 2 moves,\\
Sold a home, bought a home.

Your face shone with gratitude and gladness\\
As you hosted dinner party after dinner party,\\
Nourished friendships,\\
All through the lens of Covid.

But this year upcoming.\\
The one we haven't met yet,\\
It is in fact beyond compare.

The 21st prime, The 4th star number \[S_n=6n(n-1)+1\] (\emph{Something} rhymes with won.)

In the 1940 NFL championship game,\\
the Bears beat the Redskins 73--0,\\
(\emph{The Redskins won their previous regular season game},\\
7--3)\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73\_(number)}

\begin{quote}
Today is your day.\\
You're off to Great Places!\\
You're off and away!

OH!\\
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO! {[}\^{}3{]} {[}\^{}3{]}: Dr.~Seuss
\end{quote}

You've come home, girl,\\
After doing your piece to save\\
The pedagogy of mathematics in this brave land.\\
We anticipate buckets and buckets\\
Of things to do before you die,\\
Around \emph{Cape Horn} and \emph{penguins},\\
Who could ask for more?

Somewhere in God's plans -- Way mo' bigger than our plans --\\
A son is making plans beyond imagining Oh so shortly ago.

God's \textbf{serendipity} prevents us getting too familiar\\
with the places you'll go.\\
God's \textbf{grace} fuels your formidable smile.

It is ``Yes, yes.'' And ``Thank you, thank you.'' We'll be on our way. \textgreater{} ``It's all grace.''
