2nd night alone at the Hampton Inn. It feels so odd.

Apparent upgrade for wifi is:
Password: "Diamond2020" to Hilton Meeting

But it looks like I don't get that in the room.

Interview conversation with Cat (Catherine W.) who is one of my tutors. She described the interview as an "assignment". Mary Pat said that they were all supposed to do that. Cat is the first in my long line of tutors who has asked me the questions:

1. General recommendations?
1. What can I (the tutor) do to assist students in overcoming the difficulties of asynchronous classes?
1. Since I (the tutor) can't give answers, how can I help?
1. Most important?

I talked about the importance of just doing the work.
Related is the writing out of answers on the exams.
I told her that asking the right kind of questions would do. What sources are you using? Why do you say that?
I also emphasized the need to make connections: with own experience, with readings, with interests. Ask about that.
Reminded that students are struggling to keep asynchronous class on the horizon. Remedy is just basic encouragement re. time management.

Call for appointment to **cardiologist**.
