- **18:16**  First few hours since saying goodbye to Julian. It's peaceful. I don't feel pressure on my time and attention. And I miss him terribly.
- Looking to make "*nnn*" preview files like "*ranger*" when I discovered that *ranger* cannot access "Playfiles" while *nnn* can. #nnn
	- This was after kind of shifting my attention in my Kindles to  *Epsilon* as being more friendly to viewing files (as per, e.g. using my tablet in church).
	- The viewing worked very nicely with *tmux* and the plugin *preview-tui*.
	- It requires starting *nnn* with "-a" option (to set *NNN_FIFO*) **and** within a *tmux* session.
	- Where are my shortcuts for *tmux*? Look in *Checkvist*? [*n.b. that I am intuiting that this **logseq** might be a replacement for *Checkvist*, which is online only.*]
- Following suggestion in [[how-i-use-logseq]], I signed up for *Raindrop.io*. It will allow me to save links like I have done with *checkvist* in the past.
