Worked on [moving](moving.md):

- boxing books, weeding as I went. All but "spirituality" basically. Pleased at how few boxes, even though the boxes prompted MP to be anxious about
	- regret that we bought the wrong house
	- there won't be room for all that we move
- I told her that I understood her anxiety to be about 2 things we have no control over. We can't redo the house except in the longer term. We can't really know what's going to go where in the new house until we get there. She's didn't really get it.
- We got a shared Gdrive folder to keep the documents related to the move
- I contacted the movers and got settled with dates. We mapped out the middle of June.
- I contacted Lynn and Al -- somehow she has been particularly distraught because of them -- that somehow she had betrayed them, committed a racial insult. Lynn was glad to hear from me and we have set a date.
- I restarted and updated the Acer server and the Bee... computer. Gimp inverts color just fine, but the one app on the phone enhances the color so nicely.
- [writing](writing.md) -- well this.
- And the other is [music](music.md). I ordered the case for my keyboard.
