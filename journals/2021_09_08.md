	  _“The insight we receive on the inner journey is that chaos is the precondition to creativity: as every creation myth has it, life itself emerged from the void. Even that which has been created needs to be returned to chaos from time to time so it can be regenerated in more vital form.”_
	  — Parker J. Palmer, author of *Let Your Life Speak* and founder of the [Center for Courage & Renewal](http://www.couragerenewal.org).
