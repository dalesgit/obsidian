The collects we pray at the beginning of the liturgy have a particular form. 

1. Addressing the prayer to God.
2. Noticing a particular act, normally some aspect of glory, that God has done or is doing.
3. Spelling out a partiular request or petition for grace. Usually there is a "colon" at the beginning of this 3rd part of the collect.
4. Concluding with a signature, the bearer of the prayer, (In the name of Christ ...) (the name of the Trinity ...) and so on

Today we prayed:

> Almighty God, you have built your Church upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone: Grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their teaching, that we may be made a holy temple acceptable to you; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.Â _Amen.

I have often thought that there was a whole sermon condensed in the form of the collect of the day.

Here we are, gathered on the Sunday leading up to July 4th, Independence Day.

Here we are gathered together in the church; the church gathered in the church; the church built on the foundation of people, Apostles and Prophets, not poured concrete;  the church gathered in the church which has a cornerstone in the form of a person,Jesus Christ. We are the church, a Motley Crue of people who are nevertheless a holy temple.

I've never seen very many temples in my life. Some synagogues have the title temple. I've seen two Mormon temples. I haven't been to Asia where I think there might be lots of temples.
