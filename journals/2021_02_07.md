	  My wife Mary Pat Sjostrom and I are both seeing counselors at the center. Her mother died after midnight early this morning and her funeral will be Friday morning in Dayton, OH. I will not be able to make my appointment with Erin scheduled for 10:30 on Tuesday 2/8. We will not be able to make our appointment with Janet at 8:00 am on Friday 2/12. We will have to reschedule those appointments. Thank you for your understanding.
