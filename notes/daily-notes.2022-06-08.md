## Journal Entries
-  Mostly packed the Music room, which included 5, 6 perhaps 7 boxes of framed pictures for the movers to take.
- MP got her hair cut for the last time with Charlotte and Jo's hair person in Charlotte. She came back looking charming and her hair looked just right, as if the first (the previous) cut had been a midway preparation for today's cut. She established with the person, who visits Clearwater regularly, that they would stay in touch.
- The old Galliumos computer is working. It turns out that the "rclone" app is just an executable that can be downloaded (with .deb). The newer versions include access to pcloud. 
- Mo posted something on *Facebook* (C) about seeing a chiropractor. I don't know what's going on with her, but I reflected on how she wanted to go against the grain with medical help from long ago.
- I learned some more breadth about the processing of [[digitized-film]] I have saved in *Markdown* files a few things about graphing the color as you process inverted photos from the image of the negatives.
- for me there is a sense of accomplishment about preparing for the move. Perhaps it is just getting closer to the reality. 

## Gratitude
- For partnership with [MaryPat](MaryPat.md). I read to day the email response from [[miriam]] about my Pentecost greetings.
- the effort of Scott to keep an "every 2 week" sort of communication going. A friend.
