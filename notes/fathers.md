I received a sweet thanks from Mo for being Owen, Julian, and Miriam's dad. I responded that I knew that I had failed in so many ways at my effort to be an excellent father. Yet I knew that I had given it my all, had loved to the best of my ability.

I had said to [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) the same kind of thing when I observed that [Lydia](Lydia.md) [[fathers.lydia]] [[fathers.julian]] [[fathers.miriam]] and [[fathers.emma]] don't seem to know that they were loved in a world-class manner.

I remember the story, we've often told, of how  [Sean](Sean.md) was the first to greet me on a Father's Day on Kaua'i. My enthusiasm led to our sales person reaching out to her own father after many years of estrangement.

Ultimately [[fathers.julian]] called and Miriam sent greetings.

I have tried to explain several times over the past few days my dissatisfaction with Mothers and Fathers Day. There are several issues:

- Not every man is a biological father, nor even an adopted father
- Some of those were by choice, others not. Regret and bitterness are possible
- Many have a negative experience of fatherhood: absent, remote, self-centered, abusive, exploitative, and so on.
