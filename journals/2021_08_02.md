	  dream that I got to the altar at St. Paul's, and some folks (men) had decided that we were having wine that day and there were two flagons of it sitting on the altar. It was as if it were next Sunday. Unilateral decision that the church was going to be run by the "other" side.
	  
	  My response was the important thing. I was frustrated. Angry at the one-sided nature of the decision-making. Like when there was no communicating with Bridget or with Mary Pat. I have seen that side of the church. I've tried to do the right thing â€“ **always**. But I think I've not very often succeeded.
	  
	  It feels a little, also, like the unknown, silent, behind-my-back stuff that threatens through the phone call about an investigation that is present as a recorded voice message on Mary Pat's phone. There was information that it was odd that any one would have:
	  
	  * Aloha and Mahalo
	  * an accent that seemed perhaps African or Middle-eastern
	  * a check from St. Paul's Church
	  
	  The struggle within me had to do with my own impotence to manage or respond. **There's a message for me in my ministry with St. Paul's**. This along with the overwhelming support I found at Christ Church yesterday and have found consistently at St. Paul's.
