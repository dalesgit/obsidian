Preparing for Linda tomorrow, coming to terms with aging, character, the "unmoored" from my email to Linda.

That’s still my plan. We’re camping in our mostly unfurnished house. But we have internet. I started reading James Hillman on aging. Some word images that come to mind for me now are:

Uprooted
Unmoored
Unanchored—which might be, set sail
Disengaged from politics as well as discouraged by politics
Disillusioned by the church

Those are so many “nots”. What is it that I am?

---
That is a great question-- we can explore.  
The nots are just an expression of what you wish you were.  But it's okay to say "confused, insecure, floating, numb, waiting, just here" etc etc.  More tomorrow..,

Peace,
Linda

**Character** is the watchword in Hillman. Who are. Old age brings out.
