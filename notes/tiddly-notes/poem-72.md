# poem-72

There is no other number quite like it\
Or as your math might put it\
No other like it. Major stop.\
Two threes and thee twos, \
Multiplied. It's a fine number.\
The sum of six consecutive primes.\
In fact some have argued that Douglas Adams\
Got it wrong.  The answer to the ultimate question about life, \
The universe and everything is really 72.\
The "rule of 72" – 100 times the natural logarithm of 2 –\
Is enormously useful for discerning the effects\
Of small changes over time. \
Statistics. \
Economics. \
\
Or take that aging itself. Welcome 72.\
Or take the Bible. That's important. \
The septuagint. \
70 Jewish scholars all produced the same text.\
Or perhaps it was 72? \
6 times 12 is way better than 7 times 10.\
And more Jewish too.\
The Kabbalah has it that God has 72 names.\
Jesus was dead for 72 hours (Jonah too).\
"In the language of symbolism the number 72 \
Is in fact the Face of God." [ref ](https://houseoftruth.education/en/teaching/mona-lisa/number-72-and-4-circles)\
\
So 72 becomes you my dear\
In perhaps surprising ways.\
When I look at you I see with eyes like Lydia had,\
Age 2 or 3, as we crouched on the grass out front,\
Watching the "creatures" about their  – their what?\
Were they busy just because they were tiny?\
Do they have chores like a child has chores?\
Or just about the business of being a child of God?\
She looked with eyes of wonder at \
Creatures embodying God's wonder.\
Imagine that. You're just a little embodiment of God's delight.\
\
So if you are 72 or 2\
The beauty of your days reveals\
What so far enfolds you in his or her purpose\
That no words suffice to say "What love!"\
But perhaps a number will do.\
72.
