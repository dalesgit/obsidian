	  liminal “The world is the closed door. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through.
	  
	  Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but it is also their means of communication. … Every separation is a link.”
	  ― Simone Weil, *Gravity and Grace*
	  
	  “It seemed to me certain, and I still think so today, that one can never wrestle enough with God if one does so out of pure regard for the truth. Christ likes us to prefer truth to him because, before being Christ, he is truth. If one turns aside from him to go toward the truth, one will not go far before falling into his arms. ”
	  ― Simone Weil
	  
	  “Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes faith and love. Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer.”
	  ― Simone Weil, *Simone Weil: An Anthology*
	  
	  “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.”
	  ― Simone Weil
	  
	  “The most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know. ”
	  ― Simone Weil
	  
	  “The joy of learning is as indispensable in study as breathing is to running.”
	  ― Simone Weil, *Waiting for God*
