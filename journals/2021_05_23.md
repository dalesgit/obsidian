	  Dreaming before getting up:
	  
	  1. Making tortillas, rolling them out, ... how long to cook them? ... getting it just right.
	  1. Thinking of how Shirley is the lynch pin of the alienation in my family. However you trace it, it comes back to Shirley. Or she's somehow at the center of all dissension. She's a person who sows division.
	  
	  How do you combat that? family
