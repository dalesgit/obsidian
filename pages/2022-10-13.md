Accomplishments for the day include setting up to make 3 fishes for St. Alfred's. It keeps repeating through my head that MP [[MaryPat]] volunteered me for this. But it is satisfying at some level. 

I wish that I was responding more forcefully to what's really going on with me. I'm spending a lot of my energy keeping up with other people's agenda (most poignantly and regularly, Mary Pat).

2 days running of dreaming about my parents leaving me. Father in his remoteness. Mother in her flackiness. That is: Mother = Mo; Father = Episcopal Church. ???
