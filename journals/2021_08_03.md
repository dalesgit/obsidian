	  dream long and satisfying. I was in Hawai'i. I was in the church but also seemingly teaching stuff. I was going from place to place. Seeing people. Ruth Yoshioka was there and she was a friend, at least an ally. But maybe there was a cut, too. Mountains, snow on the mountains, a little like Colorado I guess. So maybe it was "home."
	  
	  I was getting ready for the classic travel dream, returning. But I wasn't at all sure that I was going to get on the plane. I was pretty sure I was going to stay, even though it was going to be expensive.
	  
	  It all seems somehow connected with leaving Rock Hill. Heading to a ministry that seems genuine â€“ though clearly not easy as seems clear after my talk with Nicci yesterday.
