> Andy Borowitz jokes that, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, American women are increasingly incorporating themselves as corporations, given the conservative Justices’ established friendliness to corporate interests.

WASHINGTON ([The Borowitz Report](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report))—Millions of American women and girls have declared themselves corporations in order to force the United States Supreme Court to grant them rights as people, legal observers have reported.

Attorneys across the nation indicated that they have been swamped by requests from clients seeking to incorporate as soon as possible.

“The Supreme Court decided in 2010 that corporations are people, so all we want is to be treated like corporations, ” Carol Foyler, who now goes by the corporate name FoylerCo L.L.C., said.

The decision by millions of women to incorporate sent shock waves through the Court’s conservative majority, who reportedly scoured the Constitution in vain for a means to circumvent the ingenious tactic.

Even the normally taciturn Clarence Thomas was moved to issue a rare public statement. “It’s a sad day in America when the nation’s highest court is forced to treat women like people,” he wrote.
