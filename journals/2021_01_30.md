	- I sit in a hotel room in Dayton, about to go to sleep, and Mary Pat is across town at her mothers'. It **feels very odd**.
	  
	  I just read about 2 more prompts for journaling. <https://www.wellandgood.com/journal-prompts-self-expression-whats-your-story/>
	  
	  1. Prompt 1: Why do you think you are here? What are you supposed to do with the time you have?
	  1. Prompt 2: Are you living in sync with those beliefs? If not, why not? What choices can you make today to honor your purpose?
	  
	  Finished the draft of Maundy Thursday. Shared with Tim Eden and Peter Judge:
	  
	  > Mary Pat wanted me to send this on to you. I told her family that  the influence I was thinking of was what the rabbis did in the 2nd c. at Sepporis. I said it with tongue in cheek – but not entirely. The music was taken from a resource put out by a group of Jesuits.
