### Psalm 51:1-13

*Miserere mei, Deus*

1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-**kindness**; \*  
in your great compassion blot out my of**fenses**.

2 Wash me through and through from my **wickedness** \*  
and cleanse me from my **sin**.

3 For I know my trans**gressions**, \*  
and my sin is ever be**fore me**.

4 Against you only have I **sinned** \*  
and done what is evil in your **sight**.

5 And so you are justified when you **speak** \*  
and upright in your **judgment**.

6 Indeed, I have been wicked from my **birth**, \*  
a sinner from my mother's **womb**.

7 For behold, you look for truth deep with**in me**, \*  
and will make me understand wisdom **secretly**.

8 Purge me from my sin, and I shall be **pure**; \*  
wash me, and I shall be clean in**deed**.

9 Make me hear of joy and **gladness**, \*  
that the body you have broken may re**joice**.

10 Hide your face from my **sins** \*  
and blot out all my in**iquitie**s.

11 Create in me a clean heart, O **God**, \*  
and renew a right spirit with**in me**.

12 Cast me not away from your **presence** \*  
and take not your holy Spirit **from me**.

13 Give me the joy of your saving **help again** \*  
and sustain me with your bountiful **Spirit**.
