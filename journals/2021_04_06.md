	  It was like a dream turned into a nightmare. We watched 2 episodes of *Outlander*. Geillis and Jamaica, White Witch, and jewels. And love is in the air. I went off to pee. I assumed MP went too. Then when I emerged, I heard sounds. Sounds that were like moans or groans. I didn't know what it was. I saw the closed bathroom door. So I opened it, asking is anything wrong. But it was Sean. Peeing. Evidently singing cause he happy. He stated, "No, I'm fine."
	  
	  But I wasn't fine for seeing him there. I expected to see Mary Pat. I didn't expect anything to be wrong, but I've trained or rehearsed responding to her calls for help. Someday it will be important.
	  
	  And instead it was him! Ugh. You've overspent your welcome. You're not living in reality, Dude.
	  
	  Last thing tonight, she was doing a "Poor me" rendition and said, "You'll be happier with me gone." All I was trying to do is put a limit on how much TV I watched. She said, "Sometimes I just have it on. Probably when I'm gone you won't have the TV on at all."
	  
	  That's true. I hope we get to a place where that's OK with her. It's OK with me, but not her, I think.
