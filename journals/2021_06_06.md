	  My test of "Are you glad you were here?" is, "Did I have fun?"
	  
	  **Fun** is not a bad thing. I had fun today because of:
	  
	  1. a little chuckle with humor in my sermon
	  1. singing #711 with Valierie the musician
	  1. saying "That was beautiful" after her offertory play on the piano.
	  
	  (She later referred a little to her training as a Doctorate in music performance)
