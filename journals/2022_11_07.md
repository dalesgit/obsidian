	  It's the November tradition everybody loves to hate, ***Insider's Hilary Brueck writes.*** Today, we're turning back the clocks, putting an end to daylight-saving time for the year. Evenings will get darker earlier, reminding us winter's almost here. 
	  
	  Senators on both sides of the political aisle want to do away with this annual switch back to standard time — and make daylight-saving time permanent in the spring. 
	  
	  Sleep experts, however, say that's the wrong way to go about ending clock switching. It turns out that standard time is great for our bodies. By losing a little light in the evening, we're gaining sunshine in the morning, properly aligning our devices with our biological clocks.

	- ## **When and why the lunar eclipse will occur**
	  
	  The November “[beaver moon](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/november-full-beaver-moon-17952)” will turn full at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, when the Earth is lined up between the sun and the moon. As a result, the sun will cast our planet’s shadow onto the moon, creating a [total lunar eclipse](https://www.space.com/total-lunar-eclipse-dress-rehearsal).
