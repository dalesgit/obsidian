- What is the measure of a man? A woman? A marriage?
  Is there a ruler? Is there a scale? How do you reckon it?
  Is 10 a lot? A little? Depends on 10 what? Right?
  10 ants crawling on the back lanai is better than a 1,000.
  10 grams of gold is valued today at $577.12.
- It was in my life's ancient of days that I knew
  that length of days is no way to judge 
  the quality of a person's life.
  Dale Evans' *Angel Unaware.* You know the story.
  We've had 10 years to share stories.
- Is that a lot? Is 10 times that 10 times better?
  Is knowing you and your stories quantifiable?
  Is taking you for my **isha** "no matter what" 
  a thing to be measured?
  “All Welcomed. All Loved. No Exceptions.”
  reads the motto on the church we chose.
  That's tough to incarnate.
  10 years is 10 years of enfleshing "I love you" -- no matter what.
  That's something.
- You asked once if there was **chemistry**? Oh, indeed.
  No matter what, no exceptions -- it's easier today, 
  I'm more assured, than yesterday -- multiplied back
  10 years. 
  I remember the evening by the jewelry shop along the north shore
  When I asked you to marry me. I remember it again and again.
- 10 years is long enough to know many of your stories.
  Not really long enough to hear a year's worth of 
  retelling the story in a new year's new context.
  It's long enough see you in the morning, 
  looking like a song rising from the mist off a forested lake.
  And a smile rises up within me.
- 10 years is long enough to have traveled together thousands of miles.
  There are still miles and miles that lie before us. 
  Take your pick. I would still choose you.
