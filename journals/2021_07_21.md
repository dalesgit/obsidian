	  Is this one of those times when we need to refrain from speaking?
	  
	  But how can we not speak?
	  
	  We are in the desert, a sacred place. It is where a group of former slaves was forged into a people. It is where Jesus rebuked Satan and refused to listen to his lies. It is where countless hearts have been purged of self-love as they traversed the dark night of the soul.
	  
	  We are in the desert, but in this place, too, the sower sows seed. Perhaps the parched desert soil will produce a rich harvest. We ask, not to tempt God, but because we truly do not know. What is this bread that God gives us to eat?
