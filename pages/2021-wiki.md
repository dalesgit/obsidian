		  “Knowing God without knowing our wn wretchedness makes for pride.   Knowing our own wretchedness without knowing God makes for despair.  Knowing Jesus Christ strikes the balance because he shows us both God and our own wretchedness.”
		  
		  ― Blaise Pascal, [Pensée ](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3102980)
		  
		  It is this taking responsiblity for our own heart and journey that THomas Merton desribes as 'a kind of mysterious awakening to the fact that where you are is where you belontg ... our true self – who we really are. (from Celtic Prayer, V. 2) p. 1531.

	  Prayed by Bp. Anne and posted this day by Steve Charleston
	  
	  Images of the sea and storms keep coming unbidden to my mind. \
	  I think of all of us out on the great waters of our recent history, being tossed about by the storms that swirl around us. \
	  However brave a crew we may be, there are ships among us who are lost and good people swept away. \
	  This image stays with me. It troubles me. \
	  Perhaps you understand where it comes from and perhaps it troubles you too. \
	  If so, then please join me in a shared vision today.\
	   I am praying for the waters to be calmed. \
	  For the storm to be stilled. \
	  For those in peril to be rescued. \
	  Throughout this day I am going to bring that vision to my mind, praying that the One who is able will bring peace to troubled waters. \
	  May every heart be joined in this simple but ever so powerful supplication and may all of our ancestors join us in the asking.

	  Tonight at dinner with Charlotte and Henry, I told stories:
	  
	  1. The principle of keeping church safe, is not easy and simple. But having a principle in mind allows for ... ? progress? There is the episode of Bridget's son and the Sr. Warden's daughter. But tellable story is of homeless person, mentally ill, her partner my drummer, she loved the liturgy. But she attacked Jane Oki. She was no longer welcome.
	  1. the ease of body in saying "no" to WU. But in contrast there have been times when I am defensive and my body reacts to precisely the thing I need to do but have resisted.
	  1. Lilly ?? and Elaine ?? suggested as Warden types. Scott, perhaps, as vestry. I asked the question who should recruit? Not clear.
	  1. Could we have a warden who refuses vaccine? I think, "No."

	  From my prayers tonight, world prayers
	  
	  Thanks
	  
	  BY W. S. MERWIN
	  
	  with the night falling we are saying thank you
	  we are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings
	  we are running out of the glass rooms
	  with our mouths full of food to look at the sky
	  and say thank you
	  we are standing by the water thanking it
	  standing by the windows looking out
	  in our directions
	  
	  back from a series of hospitals back from a mugging
	  after funerals we are saying thank you
	  after the news of the dead
	  whether or not we knew them we are saying thank you
	  
	  over telephones we are saying thank you
	  in doorways and in the backs of cars and in elevators
	  remembering wars and the police at the door
	  and the beatings on stairs we are saying thank you
	  in the banks we are saying thank you
	  in the faces of the officials and the rich
	  and of all who will never change
	  we go on saying thank you thank you
	  
	  with the animals dying around us
	  taking our feelings we are saying thank you
	  with the forests falling faster than the minutes
	  of our lives we are saying thank you
	  with the words going out like cells of a brain
	  with the cities growing over us
	  we are saying thank you faster and faster
	  with nobody listening we are saying thank you
	  thank you we are saying and waving
	  dark though it is

	  1. Fall of Kabul – end of longest war

	  1. Haiti

	  So much suffering in the world. What to do?
	  
	  What is the role of the church? Mother Teresa. So many other saints. Do what we can in this place at this time. One small thing with love.
	  
	  I keep thinking of the people of Palestine in 70 CE.  People at time of Black Death. The 100 years war. WW1 in France. WW2 in Poland.
	  
	  $ for resettlement of Afghani refugees. $ for Haiti. Prayers for the hurting and vulnerable.
	  
	  Remember. Tell the story.
	  
	  Some may say: "It's not my problem." Others, "Let someone else take care of it."
	  
	  Others would seek to blame: "It's their fault."

	  Apprehend God in all things, for God is in all things.\
	  Every single creature is full of God and is a book about God.\
	  Every creature is a word of God.\

	  So full of God is every creature.

	  “It is not enough merely to exist. It’s not enough to say . . . ‘I do my work well . . . I’m a good churchgoer.’ That’s all very well, but one must do something more. Seek always to do some good somewhere. —*Albert Schweitzer*
	  
	  ...
	  
	  During the pandemic we witnessed the disastrous impact of those “hostile in mind” to public health protocols and mitigation efforts. We also saw hostility manifest itself in our unwillingness to listen to those with whom we disagree. Our collective aggression and division were on full display.
	  
	  In the face of this disunity, I am drawn to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s more helpful (if esoteric!) “esemplastic imagination”: **our ability as humans to take two concepts which do not coexist in nature and combine them into a new reality. Disparate things become part of a unified whole—the very definition of being “open in mind.”**
	  
	  As children our imaginations flourished, and anything was possible. As adults too many have allowed their imaginations to atrophy, giving way to cynicism rather than possibility. Jesus, lord of the Sabbath, reminds us to remain firmly grounded, holding fast to the hope of the Gospel. Peace is possible. Concern for the common good is possible. Nurture these possibilities. Jesus sustains our life, shows us the way, and will accompany us to eternity.

	  The most terrible nightmare. I'm awake now because this was going on for an hour it seemed. I was at a museum kind of affair. It was Hawai'i, but not a place that I knew. I was in the company of Bill Mok and family. I was estranged from my wife – I guess it was Bridget – but we were somehow together at this museum. But we got separated. I was with the Mok's. And the nightmare was that I couldn't do anything. My phone didn't work. Then I lost it. I lost the car. I was wrestling with the leftover things in the little place I was staying in. **I wanted to go home. But I couldn't**. I couldn't figure it out. I felt stupid. Then abandoned. I was on my own.

		  _“The insight we receive on the inner journey is that chaos is the precondition to creativity: as every creation myth has it, life itself emerged from the void. Even that which has been created needs to be returned to chaos from time to time so it can be regenerated in more vital form.”_

	  “Is the life I am living the same as the life that wants to live in me?”
	  
	  With this searching question, Parker Palmer begins an insightful and moving meditation on finding one's true calling.
	  
	  Let Your Life Speak is an openhearted gift to anyone who seeks to live authentically. The book's title is a time-honored Quaker admonition, usually taken to mean “Let the highest truths and values guide everything you do.” But Palmer reinterprets those words, drawing on his own search for selfhood. “Before you tell your life what you intend to do with it,” he writes, “listen for what it intends to do with you. Before you tell your life what truths and values you have decided to live up to, let your life tell you what truths you embody, what values you represent.”
	  
	  Vocation does not come from willfulness, no matter how noble one’s intentions. It comes from listening to and accepting “true self” with its limits as well as its potentials. Sharing stories of frailty and strength, of darkness and light, Palmer shows that vocation is not a goal to be achieved but a gift to be received

	  dream this morning, stretching on through several "dozes" was filled with the characters of my life. Paolo was mixed in with a colorful array of Hawai'i people. The place of the dream was clearly Hawai'i, but it seemed more like New Zealand, as if it was filled with the places of my life. There wasn't a deep frustration about getting home as in so many of my dreams, but there was the challenge of coralling all the personalities. When I woke up I couldn't stop thinking about John Egan. That led to goings on at Rensselaer.
	  
	  It came up by name during this week as I observed to Charlotte and Henry that the two institutions I was involved with – during the time I have called the happiest in my life – have gone out of business.
	  
	  I'm not a wizard at picking winners or a recovery specialist. But I think I have an ability to accompany folks on a spiritual journey – if they want company. I felt that empathy-piece when Kathleen started our conversation by talking about the death of their Great Dane. I ended up ad-libbing a response, since I didn't know what to say, but I wanted to build up Kathleen. My response had to do with the desire not to get older by growing a **thick skin** and, with her help, observed that sensitive artist type have an ability to live life more fully and thus to experience death more fully.

		- ## Shusaku Endo
		  
		  *Novelist (1923–1996)*
		  
		  The novelist Shusaku Endo, who was baptized as a child following his parents’ divorce, spent much of his life pondering the ambivalence and tension implied in his identity as a Japanese and a Catholic. He later likened his faith to an arranged marriage; he tried several times to leave, but something always held him close.
		  
		  After a trip to the Holy Land, Endo developed a deep love for the image of the Suffering Servant, despised and rejected. He believed this image of the Christ who made himself nothing, an image of maternal compassion in place of an image of power and judgment, was the image that might touch the Japanese heart. He expanded these reflections in the popular Life of Jesus.
		  
		  Endo is best known for his novel Silence, which tells the story of a Portuguese Jesuit in Japan during the time of fiercest persecution. After his own arrest and torture, he is forced to watch a parade of faithful Christians go to their deaths. To spare their lives, he is finally induced to recant and trample on a holy image, after hearing the voice of Christ tell him, “Trample! Trample! I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. Trample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men’s pain that I carried my cross.”
		  
		  Endo died on September 29, 1996.
		  
		  *“God is not a punishing God, but a God who asks that children be forgiven.”*

	  Oh, Ali,
	  This is like one of the most wonderful emails I've ever received. Your trust and honesty in sharing something of your story is a treasure and I thank you profoundly.
	  
	  In terms of your conclusions about things, I mostly agree with all of them. Your stubbornness and not fitting in – yep, check that. From the sounds of it I would say you have earned your conclusions in spades. Over the years I have watched my little brother be a model for me of a loving, kind, and thoughtful person. He's also either atheist or agnostic. He loves me and I love him. I've tried to generalize over the years, thinking at times that unbelievers are better at love than Christians. But I don't really think that's the case. I've known Christians who are profoundly loving and kind also. It's also clearly the case that Christians don't have a monopoly on violence, prejudice, and evil. At this point in my life I've decided I'm content to continue to try to be kind and love and to be a witness and force against violence, prejudice and evil. As long as the Christians accept me I'm good with that. At this point I don't think there's any other place for me.
	  
	  I heard an interview with Pete Seeger many years ago. He reflected on how most of the causes that he had stood up for and fought during his long life had ultimately been losing battles. He said that what was important to him was not the winning or losing but to have spent your life with the "good people" – by which he meant the people who were fighting for and against the right things. Love, kindness, against violence, injustice etc., that sort of thing. I sometimes remind myself of his words when I feel discouraged. Your story encourages me. When I see you in church it brings me a smile. Thank you.
	  
	  Faithfully,

	  The sisters had been fascinated by the Book of the Dead. This lines at the end (quoted above) seem to be in part taken from the opening of the Egyptian book of the dead.
	  
	  The **doors of perception** was what caught my attention. It is, first and foremost for me, from Aldous Huxley – cf. college days, and his experiments with **mescalin**. In reading about that I paid attention to the note that he suffered from **iritis** for many years.
	  
	  The metaphor itself is from William Blake.
	  
	  “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”

	  > It was the Lord’s doing, not their own. It was the Lord’s power at work in and for them, which could do immeasurably more than they could ask or imagine (cf. Eph 3:20). It was sheer gift; it was grace.

	  > So is our deliverance from sin, as St. Paul reminds us in his Letter to the Romans. Of ourselves, we could never have broken the power of sin and death over us, but Jesus has done it for us. We are indeed raised from the dead, even now sharing in his eternal life. Nevertheless, sin continually attempts to ensnare us. On our own, we could never withstand it, but we can with the power of God’s grace. Our help is in the name of the Lord. We need only call upon him.

		- ## Blessed Among Us
		- ## Maura O’Halloran
		  
		  *Christian Zen Monk (1955–1982)*
		  
		  Maura O’Halloran, who was born in Boston and raised in Ireland in a large Catholic family, displayed from a young age a deep compassion for human suffering. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, she worked in soup kitchens and traveled widely in Latin America. Her concern for social justice was accompanied by a serious attraction to the spiritual life. After experimenting with various methods of prayer, she decided to explore the wisdom of the East.
		  
		  In 1979 she flew to Japan and applied for admission to a Zen Buddhist monastery in Tokyo, at the time rather a novelty for a woman in a very male setting. Her journals record her experience—sustained periods of meditation, manual labor, and an ascetic discipline of mind and body. After six months she experienced an ecstatic breakthrough, which her Master recognized as enlightenment. So impressed was he by her progress that he made an extraordinary offer—to entrust his monastery to her. But Maura did not believe this was her vocation. “I’m twenty-six and I feel as if I’ve lived my life,” she wrote. “Strange sensation, almost as if I’m close to death. . . . I’m totally content. Of course I want to get deeper, see clearer. . . . If I have another fifty or sixty years (who knows?) of time, I want to live it for other people.”
		  
		  After leaving the monastery she was killed in a bus accident on October 22, 1982. The publication of her journal brought a devoted following by both Christians and Buddhists. A small statue of her in the monastery in Japan is revered by many pilgrims.
		  
		  “*Suddenly I understood that we must take care of things just because they exist.*”—Maura O’Halloran

	  A week ago we learned about Maura O'Halloran at our daily prayer from *Give us this day.* She was a "Christian Zen Monk" who died prematurely and too young. I was so intrigued that I ordered a used copy of her journals and letters, *Pure Heart; Enlightened Mind.* When it arrived this evening, as I pulled it out of its wrapper, it fell open to a page. In the middle of the page I read:
	  
	  > "I made banana pudding. Tessan-san said, "What, no cake?" I pointed out the absence of an oven. The closest we could come was "hot cakey mix." He made a plump, delicious, greasy donuts. ... "Do you like jazz?" said Tessan-san. "Yes," said I, while thinking to myself, I'd like Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snot it uncannily was. Often, with very simple things like that, I think of something I want and it just comes. Strange.

	  Dear Emma,
	  
	  Would that there were words. Enough of them. The select right ones for the job. The job to reflect the loss of what never was. Of dreams? Perhaps. The last birthday gift I remember giving you was a kite ride above Honolulu waters. I don't know if you ever cashed it in. So many years now, I guess it doesn't matter. If there's a dream, now, I suppose it is that before I die you might walk into my room. So much gone.

	  *Beyond Self: The False Self vs. the True Self*
	  
	  Thomas Merton claims that "the superficial 'I' is not our real self," but only our "individuality" and "empirical self," not the "hidden and mysterious person in whom we subsist before the eyes of God."20Thomas Merton, /New Seeds of Contemplation/ (Abbey of Gethsemani, Inc., 1961), This kind of thinking is found also in Keating and Pennington.
	  
	  Keating states that CP takes us to a place:
	  
	  "...in which the knower, the knowing, and that which is known are all one. Awareness alone remains. The one who is aware disappears along with whatever was the object of consciousness. This is what divine union is."21Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's

	  "God and our true Self are not separate. Though we are not God, God and our true Self are the same thing."22Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open
	  Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's Monastery, 1992), 127 According to Merton, our "external, everyday self" is mostly a "fabrication" and is not "our true self" which:
	  
	  "is not easy to find. It is hidden in obscurity and 'nothingness,' at the center, where we are in direct dependence on God."23Thomas Merton, /Contemplative Prayer/ (The Merton Legacy Trust, 1969; Garden City, NY: Image Books Edition, Division of Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971), 70
	  
	  Buddhism teaches that our identities are merely fleeting images or impressions, like images on film, or a "sequence of happenings, of processes,"24Joseph Goldstein, "Exercise/ Easting" in Jean Smith, ed., /Breath Sweeps Mind: A First Guide to Meditation Practice/ (NY: Riverhead Books, 1998), 184

	  Blessed Among Us
	  
	  Gordon Zahn
	  
	  Peacemaker (1918–2007)
	  
	  Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Gordon Zahn was in most respects a traditional Catholic—except in his inability to reconcile the teachings of Christ with orders to kill his fellow humans. In 1942 he declared himself a conscientious objector, though no priest or bishop would support his stand. He was assigned to a work camp for Catholic conscientious objectors, supported by the *Catholic Worker*. Afterward he had trouble finding a Catholic college that would accept him. Nevertheless, he earned a doctorate in sociology and taught at several universities.
	  
	  In 1963 his book *German Catholics and Hitler’s Wars* showed how Germany’s bishops, through their general exhortations of loyal obedience to authority, had become instruments of Nazi power. This was followed by In *Solitary Witness*, which recovered the lost story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian peasant executed for his refusal to serve in Hitler’s army. Zahn’s work, including his personal lobbying, was influential in moving the Council Fathers at Vatican II to support recognition of the right of conscientious objection.
	  
	  Zahn worked tirelessly in the cause for peace, helping to found *Pax Christi USA*. In later years he suffered from Alzheimer’s—and thus was unable to recognize the significance of an invitation in October 2007 to attend the beatification of Franz Jägerstätter. He died two months later on December 9.
	  
	  “*All Christians, whether they realize it or not, have that vocation (in the full religious sense) of serving the cause of peace and, by logical extension, the obligation to oppose war.*”
	  
	  —Gordon Zahn

	  [[Journal] sending me an excerpt from *Naked Now* by Richard Rohr
	  
	  Thank you for this! Not only do I recognize this in connection with yesterday's conversation but I recognize it in my own life. The telling thing for me of what you said was, "There is no 'goal' (in spiritual direction), but if there was one, this is what it would be." Part of what is important in the relationship with Mary Pat is her memory of the teaching her priest gave her as she was discerning her own move to Hawai'i. The priest suggested the possibility that there wasn't a task to do there, but only "to be." As I have heard more than once, perhaps from Richard Rohr, that the goal is to accept that we are loved. There is, of course, a long tradition of seeing the goal as some kind of unity with God. In the counter-cultural ways of my college years, I persuaded a German professor to let me complete my language requirement with an independent study of Meister Eckhart. I did the same with one of my English requirements with an independent study of 14th c. English Mystics – that involved one of my tenderest memories of my father where he helped me photocopy an inter-library loan of the Cloud of Unknowing. The block plan at Colorado College allowed me to take a course in "Christian Mysticism" in the Wind River Range of Wyoming. A lot of this trajectory was influenced by memorizing large quantities of W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot. Most people would say, "What are you thinking?" It made sense to me then and is an important confirmation/memory now. Thanks.
