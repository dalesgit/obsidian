### Psalm 51:1-13

*Miserere mei, Deus*

1Â Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-**kindness**; *  
in your great compassion blot out my of**fenses**.

2 Wash me through and through from my **wickedness** *  
and cleanse me from my **sin**.

3 For I know my trans**gressions**, *  
and my sin is ever be**fore me**.

4 Against you only have I **sinned** *  
and done what is evil in your **sight**.

5 And so you are justified when you **speak** *  
and upright in your **judgment**.

6 Indeed, I have been wicked from my **birth**, *  
a sinner from my mother's **womb**.

7 For behold, you look for truth deep with**in me**, *  
and will make me understand wisdom **secretly**.
