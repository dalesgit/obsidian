## Journal Entries
-  I have just finished a 30 min. session on treadmill. 10 incline. Pace 3.0. It was made especially enjoyable because there was a drone video of hiking through forest and mountain villages, along streams, etc. 

I was listening to lectures on **myth**, mostly on Otto Rank & Joseph Campbell on the mono-myth of the **hero**. Rank a Freudian, Campbell a Jungian. I thought again and again of Owen as the hero is dealing with repressed parricide and incest. The lecturer emphasized that the modern thinker is going to emphasize psychological interpretations of the myths, rather than, e.g., religious or ???. 

- I solved today's "Wordle" in 4 words. It was satisfying.

## Gratitude
- for session on treadmill
- for getting "nnn"  into usable shape.
- installed "deadbeef". it is quick and versatile.
