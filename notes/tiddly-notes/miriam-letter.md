# Miriam

GrammaBridget

Yet another mystery is added to the larger one for me. It really seems as if where there is a narrative that causes a daughter to give back a gift from her father, there is a narrative that is somehow rotten – "something's rotten in Denmark." Someone or someones have become committed to perpetuating the narrative. If I had some awareness of what could cause such hatred, I might be able to make sense out of the "two sides." But even the people who would be in a position to know something about what the issue is or was have refused to answer my inquiries. Seemingly to be accused of something but never told what it was seems particularly cruel. But that is the reality of the world that God has dealt me. It's in its own way eternally sad, but in the scheme of love that permeates our universe far beyond anything I can imagine, it is but a drop in the world's ocean.

In an odd turn of reality, words that once in my youth seemed so pointed and resonant now become something that I live.

Can you enter the great acorn of light?\
                  But the beauty is not the madness\
Tho’ my errors and wrecks lie about me.\
And I am not a demigod,\
I cannot make it cohere.\
If love be not in the house there is nothing.\
The voice of famine unheard.\
How came beauty against this blackness,\
Twice beauty under the elms —\
                   To be saved by squirrels and bluejays?\
(*Canto 116*, Ezra Pound)

The author wrote the words near the end of his life. At one time I might have felt particular kinship with the "**errors and wrecks**", but today what seems more relevant is the **acorn of light**. A younger person might have the luxury of being concerned with two sides. I don't anymore. At an earlier time in his life the author wrote, "What thou lovest well remains, the rest is dross." The truth of that line will have to be enough for me.

What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee\
What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage\
Whose world, or mine or theirs\
                                            or is it of none?\
First came the seen, then thus the palpable\
        Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell,\
What thou lovest well is thy true heritage\
What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee\
 \
The ant’s a centaur in his dragon world.\
Pull down thy vanity, it is not man\
Made courage, or made order, or made grace,\
         Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down.\
\
(*Canto 81*, written from an American prison cell)
