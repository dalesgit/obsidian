- Thought journey I had following my talk with [[+Dabney]]. I felt that there was not a lot of personal connection, even though I worked pretty hard to cultivate it: "I didn't know it was that cold" story; my journey of **trying to retire**; sharing about the people I have known with **multiple myloma**. Dabney didn't seem to pursue personal things like asking about [[Marypat]].
