- connecting with Pi'ikea (Mia's mom) brought back memories.
- Lydia not communicating left me wondering.
- I touched Miriam with a few comments -- she seemed connected.
- I remembered that in the 90's Bridget [[bridget]] had walked out of the last Marriage counseling we'd had. I spent the rest of the sessions trying to process what **I was going to do** with the evident failure of the marriage. Bob F. knew that there were problems with the marriage. He told me much later that he had hoped the move to Hawai'i would help. My recollection is that indeed the marriage was broken when we moved to Hawai'i. 
- I owe Murray a phone call.
