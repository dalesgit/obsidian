One of my goals for the trip was to write. I have gathered information from a range of sources. And I have aimed to write every day under a heading that I have called "Sacramental". The heading is my short-hand way of referring to theme in my life that Linda has called "incarnational". It is not easy for me to succinctly say what that refers to. It is Eucharistic. It is mystical. It is religious. It is walking among penguins in all their "poop" and cuteness, honoring their being as wild animals. I have had the blessing of seeing them swim, "birds designed to swim." Our first penguins were seen in Peru. The tops of my hands were sunburned to blistering that day. Probably the last penguins will be those could have petted yesterday in Puerto Martyn, Argentina. I have said several times to various folks that all I wanted to do on this trip was to see a penguin, and now I've done that, indeed seen thousands. 

I expected there to be more leisure time. But there has been enough of it to read a number of books, each of them setting me to self-reflection and recognizing connections with my current life. I had the sense from the beginning that I wanted to press this occasion for looking at my life and making sense of it. James Hillman's work on "character" was helpful. It recognized that a part of the vocation of a grey-haired part of one's life is to take stock of the life that has been lived. He sees "character" as an interpretive framework to make that work. Character is the result of a lived life. The decisions of day upon day, year upon year, fashion and hammer out the character of who we are. At the same time, character drives the decision-making. The cruise has encouraged me in the task of embracing who I am and who I have become. 
One of the ongoing conversations in this cruise community is the planning and reviewing of "excursions" on the days we are in port. From early on I have wondered to myself how to think about or anticipate these tourist events. Clearly a few hours in a city of a foreign land is not remotely adequate for getting to know anything about the people or place. The price often seems to be overly-inflated, pushing it out of the "yes" category. Yet the planned trips out of the ship are a significant way of gaining at least a "taste" of the flavor these places we are seeing. One important result of the route has been to emphasize to us that we know so little about the southern hemisphere. By the time we got to Antarctica, we had an almost shocking insight about the area surrounding earth's southern-most continent. There is no other place on earth where ocean currents go entirely around the globe without being disrupted by other land masses. During one of our first excursions, I turned to Mary Pat and said, "I could live in Costa Rica." Some of the places seem more compatible and others less so. At the same time, virtually every place we have  been I have felt that I'd like to spend a months or years to get to know the place and people. That is, of course, sheer fantasy on my part, given the twilight time of my life. It does speak, however, to a certain empathetic way of life that has followed me all my life and is still there to this day.

One of the books I've read is the novel *The Missionaries*. The characters of the dramatic narrative are actors in what Eisenhower long ago called the *military-industrial complex*. In today's world, of course, the capabilities are vastly upgraded, from room-sized computers to iphones in everyone's hands, from transportation facilitated by trucks on Interstates to devastation delivered by drones. The contemporariness of the novel is felt in the South American locus of the culminating action. These places we see are so deeply impacted by the injustice imposed by the marauding imperialists. The world we live in is so fragile. We are all to blame. We are all responsible. In watching *The Mission* we hear: "If might makes right there is no room for God (love?). I don't have strength to live in such a world." I have struggled figuring out what to do with the news that gets through to us. There is some regular news -- with the exception of the 5 days sailing around Antarctica. But what to do with it? I feel the same tension I have generally felt over the decades. I conclude there is no salvation in politics. The world we live in is probably facing debilitating environments. And yet -- one of my readings has been the Dalai-Lama and Abp. Tutu on **joy**. And yet, what is there but to end one's life with a "thank you" on our hearts?

I have thought that the focus of each day, each moment, is in finding **beauty**. It feels so discouraging to hear so many people complaining and demanding here on the ship. None of it, noticeably, coming from staff, who always have a smile and warm greeting. I often feel alienated from many of the "guests". Yet I am one of them. Each day I am aware that we guests survive because of the massive work of all the "essential workers." It seems such a little thing to make a verbal "Thank you" as often as I can. Yet sometimes the essential workers seem to respond to the gratitude. 

Together with **beauty** it has seemed to me that our lives are lived in a kind of **proximity** of the sacred and profane. It has been an exotic filled trip so far. Yet I return to the same kind of reflections I began with. We are now only about half through the trip. Much remains. More to come.
