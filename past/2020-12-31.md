- So this year is coming to an end.
    
I have spent the day essentially in mourning. Not for the losses of Covid. Not even so much for the bitterness of 6 months with Sean in this household, in spite of the countless ways that MP has insured that he has determined our lives in countless ways.

	  She has asked him to set the table when he was not in the room and I had just spent 15 minutes clearing the dishwasher and was standing right next to her. I think the new years celebration she had been planning was mostly for Sean's sake. The timing of the meal was very rushed and intended for Sean to be able to make his meeting, a meeting that had some of the trappings of an alternative New Year's Eve gathering.
	  
	  <u>Common Prayer</u> noted that this was the traditional celebration of "**Watch Night**" when African-Americans waited for the emancipation that would begin the next day. Mary Pat commented that it was well-known from her Atlanta days.
	  
	  The mourning was for the loss of hope in my marriage. I have spent the last 24 hours since meeting with Janet depressed and discouraged. MP has cuddled and been upbeat. I have not had room for any of it.
