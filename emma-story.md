# Emma -- an unfinished life #

[Personal](/checklists/445416)

## Precious daughter
Since the 70's my first instinct was to root for the girls over the boys.

Fathers and daughters. Fathers and sons. I have wrestled with my relationship with my parents. I have tried to be sensitive to the dynamics I see in others.

My teacher at Notre Dame, John S. Dunne, told me once that one's spiritual life didn't begin until both parents were gone. His whole career had been built on pulling his broad Catholic spirituality and mysticism out of the clouds and into the stuff of every day life. I heard from someone that in the 70's, when students enrolled in the fall, there were a myriad tables spread out -- you know what I mean, labeled "A-Az", "B-Bz", and so on. There in the cavernous geodesic dome, there would be one table set aside as "Prof. John Dunne."

Isaac was fooled (was he already a fool in his old age?) by his wife Rebeccah and son Jacob to bestow the blessing on the someday named "Israel" instead of the hairy eldest, Esau.

Since my own childhood, I have spontaneously rooted for the underdog. Did I see myself as a perennial underdog? Did it seem all the more magnificent when the undervalued prevailed?

It seems related to an old adage that a parent loves each of their children in the way that they need loving at any particular moment. It was intended to defeat the claim of one child or another that they were the "favorite".

Emma was the last child I sired. The baby, as it were. I am writing this memory, because this last of my children has been the subject of more anguish than any of the others. It is because she was special, I guess, in some way.

## Conception
So much of her early life there was a swirling around me, a roller coaster of up and down. I spent lots of energy trying to re-vitalize a congregation. I spent energy throughout the week trying to nurture a step-son. He accompanied me to church on school days because he attended just across the street at the Catholic School. That lasted until it was time for middle school.

Emma's mother seemed invested in a place almost an hour's drive away. Her "family" was in South Bend. We lived in Michigan City. She had made me promise when we married that I would not ask her to move away from her family. Her job was there. Her sense of who she was was wrapped up in the identity of work in a health-care setting.

It was a rocky time in the marriage. From the beginning. She had begun asking for a divorce from 1992 onward. But then there were periods of calm, even ebullience. What was that about? I never knew.

In such a space and time the news was dropped that her mother was pregnant. The context for me was that whatever comes in my life, my task was to make a blessing out of it. First do what it takes to make it work. Then my calling was to pour myself out in love and devotion. 

Some of that may well have been that I wanted desperately to provide what my father had not. It was also that I already carried a keen sense of not being able to live up to the expectations I placed on myself. I had not done well at fathering my little brother, David. I had failed in so many ways at fathering the children of my first marriage, even as I had tried desperately at times to do the right thing. With these children, I thought, I will provide the love and nurture that will outlast and outshine all others.

Bluster and self-delusion, I suppose.

## Birth

I was determined to be present at the birth of Emma. Determination that I be present.

Alarm went off at the elevator as we attempted to bring her home.

## Fathering

My understanding of "Fathering"

My self-conception and determination in being able to quiet my child -- was challenged by Emma

Strong-willed -- not easily comforted

Bathing

Carrying her on shoulders to pre-school

## The Police?

stolen without notice -- in this case by the **state**

unaware of what was wrong

Interviewed on Sunday by an officer -- he found no indication of abuse

Where was Emma those 2-3 days?

## Bicycle

Fierce determination

-- when she put her mind to it.

She got up to ride around the cul-de-sac -- but had no ability to stop, running into a bush at a neighbor's house

The girls buried in leaves.
## In church

In procession with a "humph" marching behind Bp. Gray

cf. also suddenly squealing having switched up the amp at church

She would frequently request Chapin's "Flowers are red"

## Travel outside the country

Riding the pony in Canada

Standing alongside the water flowing over Niagara Falls

## Pikes Peak

## Determination to swim

## Kindergarten in Hawai'i

Trip to Grandma's dying

## Exchange students in the home.

This was Dale's dream, not Bridget's

### Mia stayed for a semester

The delight I had in driving her to school. How were the girls getting to the Priory?

### Leen

Common theme by then that Bridget turned against the "interloper"

Facebook

Waikiki by herself

"Daddy, you fix it."

Struggled with e.g. math

Played violin

## Sisters

"They're sisters!", said with a smile.

The insight that Lydia and Emma were each of them envious for what the other had.

Calling "911" from "Mama Sue's"

There was some ambivalence about whether the *Priory* was the right school for Emma. It clearly was for her sister. Did she vacillate about going? I can't remember. Perhaps she wanted to follow in her sister's path. Perhaps she wanted to blaze her own trail. But I knew that her needs were very different from Lydia's.

## Life is fleeting
Associate with her the movie *Rent* and the lyrics.
