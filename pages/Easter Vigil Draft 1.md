# Opening

When I was a child I spoke like a child, I thought like a child. When I was a child I experienced Easter pretty much like Fr. Peter shared last Sunday. There was Palm Sunday, with the pomp and procession. Then there was Easter. 

When I was a child, I knew my name and I knew that my parents were Helen and Dale. I tolerated my siblings for the most part. It was only later that I began to realize that one of the great challenges of life was to figure who I really was and meant to be. Later still did I begin to grasp that it wasn't even about me, that I was a part of a larger story.

I was in my 20's that I experienced my first Easter Vigil. We didn't have such a thing when I was a child in the church. I returned to the church, trying to be an adult and to figure out what an adult faith looks like. I'm still working at it.

That first Easter Vigil was the first of many that would follow -- up to the present moment. I have come to experience this liturgy as the fullest possible expression of **who we are as Christians**, as human beings, as children of God. Through the years, what we do here tonight, has often taken my breath away.
- # Lighting Fire
  
  The volcano Kilauea on the big island in Hawaii was in a continuous eruption from 1983 until 2018. Before we left the islands we had an opportunity to see the eruption at work. We left at dusk on an ocean going catamaran that took us down the coast. As the sun set, the waves that bounced us around became filled with sparkles of light. Our daughter Amy was gleeful because it was like a roller coaster ride. Finally we began to approach the point where the lava was flowing into the water. It was night. There was a snake trail of red-orange coming down the slope, while several sites along the rocky edge had molten water falls into the surf below. We could feel the heat. What I also felt was **awe!**
  
  It felt to me like I was entering the dawn of creation. I was somehow present as God was in the act of creating the universe. I felt like I knew **whose** I was. I somehow belonged to the God of creation.

With this festival of light that we experience on this night, we are called to recognize our kinship with a god of fire and worlds begotten. but it is not only a creating God, but a God, who gives up himself or herself in a consuming fire.
  
  Annie Dillard relates a similar awesome image of fire, but this one an intimate picture.
  
  One night she was quietly soaking in the wonders of the creation about her and she saw a moth fly into a candle flame. The moth was caught by the fire, consumed and held. Its wings were immediately ignited like tissue paper, and in an instant they were gone. Most of the moss was quickly consumed, except that there was a shell , a skeleton, there in the bit of the flame. And that skeleton began to act as a wick. The wax rose in the moth body from her soaking abdomen to her thorax to the jagged hole, where her head should be, and widened to flame, Ron, yellow flame that robbed her to the ground, like any immolating monk.  (P. 17 oh, holy the firm.)
  
  This night calls us into relationship with a God, who gives all that there is in the divine in order to be in relation to this humble world. The fire calls us each by name and gives us the name of our family. It is the family named *Christian*.
