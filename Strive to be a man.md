**Bret:** Gail, let’s close on a more uplifting note. The single best piece in The Times last week was [Joseph Berger’s moving obituary for Adolfo Kaminsky](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/world/europe/adolfo-kaminsky-dead.html), who, as a Jewish teenager in Nazi-occupied France, saved thousands of lives by using his chemistry skills to produce forged identity papers for those at risk of being deported to concentration camps. On one occasion, he worked two days straight to deliver 900 birth and baptismal certificates and ration cards for 300 Jewish children, giving them crucial time to escape to neutral Switzerland or Spain. The piece is a powerful reminder of Rabbi Hillel’s declaration in the Mishna that, “In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man.”

May his memory be for a blessing.
