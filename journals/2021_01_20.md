	  * Three (3( things that happened today
	  
	  Today was an inauguration. I tried to evoke new beginnings on Sunday. There's something deep/down about new beginnings. Lydia & Emma, Leen.
	  
	  Watching the musical entertainment / inspiration led by Tom Hanks tonight was at times emotional and inspiring. Hearing from ordinary people â€“ whom Joe Biden had held for honoring.
	  
	  I messaged Lydia, saying it reminded me of her. She didn't respond.
	  
	  I continue to feel deep resentment? anger? disappointment? at the effects of Sean and of MP's judgment over me. It happened as I tried to facilitate breakfast and all we ended up with was estrangement.
	  
	  I saw a video posted on Lydia's Facebook, taken by Nick, I think taken of fireworks in Honolulu, filmed from Kaimuku by KCC.
	  
	  I had my first week of Zooming with classes under my built. The connecting with students was the one thing that was rewarding for me. Thank you.
	  
	  Lectures on Sophocles and Euripides. They wrote during a time of changing attitudes toward the gods, their interaction with humans, and the old mythic values toward developing "humanistic" values.
