A can of beans is a powerhouse ingredient to keep on hand, especially when it comes to making soups. You can easily add protein and fiber to these soups, from creamy bowls to slow-cooker recipes. Plus, these dishes are rated with four- and five-stars, so we know you’ll love them. Try recipes like our Sweet Potato Soup with Crispy Tortilla Topping and our Kale, White Bean & Pasta Soup, and you’ll always want to stock a can of beans in your pantry.

This fiber-rich soup is an easy, healthy dinner when you’re pressed for time. This brothy soup is finished with a bit of heavy cream for body and richness. For a thicker soup, mash 1/2 cup of the beans and stir into the soup right before adding the cream. Frozen sweet potatoes and collard greens keep the prep to a minimum, but if you have a little extra time on your hands, fresh veggies work just as well. Serve with crusty bread for dunking.

This one-pot chicken and cabbage soup is topped with flavor-boosting store-bought pesto. Big, fiber-rich butter beans add a creamy bite, but you can easily swap them out for cannellini beans or navy beans if you prefer. This soup works well with leftover chicken—simply shred or chop cooked chicken and add it to the soup to reheat once the cabbage is tender.

Cooking the pasta in the soup is an easy and efficient way to add body.

In this flavorful soup recipe, sweet potatoes simmer in a quick coconut curry, resulting in a creamy, thick broth punctuated by notes of garlic and ginger. We love peanuts for their inexpensive price and versatile flavor. They're also a great source of protein--1 ounce has 7 grams.
