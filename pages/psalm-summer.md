# Fifth Sunday after the Epiphany
### Psalm 147:1-12, 21c

*Laudate Dominum*

1 Hallelujah!  
How good it is to sing praises to our **God**! *  
how pleasant it is to honor him with **praise**!

2 The Lord rebuilds Je**rusalem**; *  
he gathers the exiles of **Israel**.

3 He heals the broken**hearted** *  
and binds up their **wounds**.

4 He counts the number of the **stars** *  
and calls them all by their **names**.

5 Great is our Lord and mighty in **power**; *  
there is no limit to his **wisdom**.

6 The Lord lifts up the **lowly**, *  
but casts the wicked to the **ground**.

7 Sing to the Lord with thanks**giving**; *  
make music to our God upon the **harp**.

8 He covers the heavens with **clouds** *  
and prepares rain for the **earth**;

9 He makes grass to grow upon the **mountains** *  
and green plants to serve man**kind**.

10 He provides food for flocks and **herds** *  
and for the young ravens when they **cry**.

11 He is not impressed by the might of a **horse**; *  
he has no pleasure in the strength of a **man**;

12 But the Lord has pleasure in those who **fear him**, *  
in those who await his gracious favor.

21 Halle**lujah**!
