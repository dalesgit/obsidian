Sometimes it seems she doesn't care for anything I do or think. Then she'll recover and be clingy or overly solicitous.

Sometimes I'm afraid of moving to be alone with her in Florida. Other times I am so eager and hopeful.

I often look at her with adoring eyes and am so glad that I am spending my life with her.
