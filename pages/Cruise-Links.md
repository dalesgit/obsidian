	- *The following cities have yet to be totally overrun by tourists:*
		- Udaipur, India. A little more peaceful and spread out compared to other popular cities in India.
		- Lima, Peru. A lively capital city that gets overlooked, but shouldn’t.
		- Brussels, Belgium. Make sure to book a chocolate tour.
		- Valparaiso, Chile. From street art to rainbow houses, this city is unbelievably colorful.
		- Puglia, Italy. Wine, pasta, and beaches.
		- Budapest, Hungary. The “Little Paris of Middle Europe.”
		- Dubrovnik, Croatia. Bummed about Hobbiton? This is the main filming location for King’s Landing in HBO’s Game of Thrones.
		- Denmark’s Faroe Islands. Sheep outnumber humans 70,000 to 50,000 here.
		- Java, Indonesia. Less-visited than Bali, but just as beautiful.
		- Petra, Jordan. Known as the “Rose City,” Petra is a series of caves, temples, tombs, and ruins carved from pink sandstone.
		- Luang Prubang, Laos. The perfect spot for day trip to remarkable aqua waterfalls.
		- Taipei, Taiwan. This capital city has a culinary scene to die for.
