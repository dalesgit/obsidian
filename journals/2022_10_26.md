- I have completed extracting Tiddly's non-journal files in Obsidian.
- I am working my way through extracting Tiddly's 2021 journal files (Jan.)
- Asking myself is this worth all the time I spend on it?
- For today sense of accomplishment perhaps is
  1. make soup
  2. exercise
- TODO I think I would like to draft something for the Hawai'i retired clergy reflections.
