	- Sewing kit
	- Flash Memory for the phones

- Call with [[Lydia]]
	- She responded to my question, "How can I help" by saying, "Basically do what you're doing."
	- She reported that she ruled out going to the wedding because  the next Monday is beginning of school and getting in late would be too difficult.
	- She texted later that she would try to make it work for a flight arriving by 4pm on Sunday. 
	- That set in motion a series of stuff that culminated in getting a flight for Lydia and getting David (Laura) and Bill angry with me.
	- **How did I become the bad guy in all this?**
	- She has tickets.

- Call with [[Miriam]]
	- She is inwardly planning to do a kind of "sabbatical" in honor of her writing for 10 years (as of 2024)
	- She wants to talk before we leave on our trip.
	- In a follow-up call with Miriam I learned that she is planning to drive down with Owen, Julian, Michelle & kids. 
	- Owen is planning on being in an Air B/B. Miriam changed her mind that she wanted to stay in one by herself; so she will arrange that. [[marypat]] observed that Miriam doesn't like staying with other people -- ala the way we were treated at Lydia's wedding.
- Getting Lydia to [[David]]'s wedding
	- Call with [[Bill]] re. 
		- He was concerned about the logistics of it all.
		- I learned that Emma / Mitto are staying with David/Laura (and Renato + girl friend + nephew from Spain). Apparently they're paying for their air flights as well.
		- Albuquerque hotel with the wedding is $200 / night.
		- Bill had reached out to Lydia via  text.
		- Bill's concern is organizing a hot-air balloon ride. But when? It evidently isn't going to happen with the Hathaway clan
- I feel just awful. Bill hung up on me. That's as alienated as we've felt in a number of years. It was prompted, I think by saying something about "Emma". Once again it feels like everybody else knows stuff about Emma that I don't. Or  I'm not allowed to harbor difficult feelings about Emma. And I am left saying, "Fuck it." When before I got all the **push-back** I was feeling like I was participating in a **God-thing**. So good for Lydia in so many ways. All the pieces just seemed to fall into place.
