- I'm extremely fortunate to be in the area where St. John's Tampa was where his father was rector.
- Lots of retired clergy but lots of variation in what they expect, want.
- Stephen Gerth in Naples
- great rector (troubled past) who 2 rectors ended up being deposed. Went to the Church on Easter Sunday to tell them. Then a few years later on the 1st Sunday after Easter. Recovering mode with mission mindedness. Dunedin priest doing well. Some others e.g. Holy Trinity near to us. In terms of your background St. Alfred's maybe best for me. Ascension rector (larger) is new. Sewanee.
- Absolutely need for supply. You will be used. Not all the time, but regularly. Seasonal.
- Form from diocesan web site. He doesn't have to check if I'm a priest.
- 7 1/2 years dealing with multiple myloma. Underneath lots of stories. Chronic and manageable (uncurable)
- constantly saying southern most of upper midwest.
- every opinion present in every congregation (healthy in his view)
- when he met a place of deep mistrust. He said to the clergy you don't have to
