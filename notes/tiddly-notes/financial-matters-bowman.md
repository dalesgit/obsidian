# FinancialIssues

Meeting with David Bowman

My 32K IRA has MP primary and 3 children contingent. Need to add at least Lydia. Divide % differently, emphasis Julian?

MP wants to make 300K account to her 2 kids.
Already a 300K account has them as contingent, me as primary.

RMD we're going to do RMB this year, 1 before tax season (depending on tax ) we want to keep in qualified account as long as possible.

David backdrop is "Dairy Barn" – he says it's a good place to visit.

David expects a pretty-much stable year. Not booming the way the past year.

MP has an account Lincoln annuity? of ca. 200K that she could get a a guaranteed annual income of close to 9K. 2 ways to take $ out of an annuity. 1) **annuitize** & 2) withdrawals. David doesn't support "annuitize".

He and family appreciate "Hello Fresh" food service, meals to serve 4.

He has repeated his desire that we would be able to start doing things we want to do – travel etc. We're getting older and the opportunity is shrinking. (My stage of life stuff with Linda) LostInGrief
