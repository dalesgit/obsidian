- Thought journey I had following my talk with [[+Dabney]]. I felt that there was not a lot of personal connection, even though I worked pretty hard to cultivate it: "I didn't know it was that cold" story; my journey of **trying to retire**; sharing about the people I have known with **multiple myloma**. Dabney didn't seem to pursue personal things like asking about [[Marypat]].
	- I asked myself yesterday whether I was envious of Bob Fitzpatrick and Dabney, regular dudes in my past? My main response is that I don't think I ever would have wanted the giant headaches of those "VIP's". I wonder, though. cf.
