	  I haven't recorded that the information was reported to me for the first time in counseling session yesterday was that Sean will not be staying at the house while Mary Pat is gone. In the session she tried to bring back the accusations that I hated Sean and rejected him and she would never do that with my children, and blah, blah, blah. All of it not true and beside the point.
	  
	  So today I meditated again and again on Sean not being able to deal with me. I had assured that there was no problem there. MP said that she had objected to Sean doing that, but "it's his decision."  There is just so much that is not acceptable to me.
	  
	  So, now at the end of the evening, he's going to move out. I intend to change the code on the garage door. Mary Pat is going to concentrate on family and grieving issues. Janet has assigned us to concentrate on "**dating**" behavior. It's not really clear to me what that is. "Focus on hope." "The kinds of things we did when dating and getting to know one another." Flowers. Little notes.
