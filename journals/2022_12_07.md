- Readwise trial ending
  collapsed:: true
	- Thanks for taking the time to try Readwise over the past 30 days. Unfortunately, now is the end of your trial and in order to continue using Readwise you'll need to:
	- [Upgrade your account](https://readwise.io/upgrade?ref=downgrade&et=fcb3794b-fb42-4b27-a730-79cf1d7d05ff)
	- There are two plans:
	- Readwise Lite, which is just the daily review & email, or
	    Full Readwise which gets you all of our hardcore features like tagging, note-taking, Evernote, etc.
	- If you're not ready to upgrade, you can also refer your friends to use Readwise and get an extra month of full Readwise for each friend who joins.
	- Until you do one of the above, you will no longer receive your daily Readwise emails or be able to review your highlights on the Readwise site. You can always export your data in csv format or delete your account, however.
	- Regardless of your choice, we want to say thank you for trying out Readwise. We know it's been an investment of your time, and we appreciate you giving us a chance :)
	- Thanks,
	- Tristan & Dan (the Readwise Team)
	- PS. If you have any questions or need any help, please don't hesitate to reply to this email. We'd love to chat!

- **14:53** Becky [[becky-friedenberg]] phone call
  collapsed:: true
	- Her priest has agreed that she should begin the process of discernment for holy orders
	- I told of Bp. Tom Ray's insight about theology of ministry
	- Henri Nouwen, *Wounded Healer* + some other book?
	- I told her of the old priest who told me to try to do anything other than be a priest.
	- She responded about Lydia's news that she had been through with her parents what mine are going through with me.
		- When she was going through divorce 20 years ago, she asked to come be with them and they refused
	- The "be there for her" is huge, but for me can be ambiguous: fatuous and without significance but also how to do it?
	- She offered what I had said, that Lydia could help me to know how to help.
	- I wonder about how much Lydia's lack of verbal response is a function of her distrust in her own communication abilities
	- Becky also pointed to how those who are depressed descend into a hole. She didn't seem to know about Lydia's history.
	- I couldn't very well remember when she started that, the medication, etc. I also don't know when she may have stopped taking it.
	- Is it related to what happened with Nick?
