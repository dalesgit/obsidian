	  Talking with Gordon about Lancaster (Christ Church)
	  
	  * 3-4 at an early service, but they will probably consolidate that by June
	  * communion has been handled: serious handwashing, tongs to place host on platter, platter placed centrally. Gordon says that some really want to be able to kneel, so that may be moved by June
	  * a few ultra-conservative, but many others leftish. mixed-race couple, gay couple, etc.
	  * they've had music for a while
