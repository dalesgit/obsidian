- ## Precious daughter
	- Since the 70's my first instinct was to root for the girls over the boys.
	  
	  Fathers and daughters. Fathers and sons. I have wrestled with my relationship with my parents. I have tried to be sensitive to the dynamics I see in others.
	  
	  My teacher at Notre Dame, John S. Dunne, told me once that one's spiritual life didn't begin until both parents were gone. His whole career had been built on pulling his broad Catholic spirituality and mysticism out of the clouds and into the stuff of every day life. I heard from someone that in the 70's, when students enrolled in the fall, there were a myriad tables spread out -- you know what I mean, labeled "A-Az", "B-Bz", and so on. There in the cavernous geodesic dome, there would be one table set aside as "Prof. John Dunne."

	  Isaac was fooled (was he already a fool in his old age?) by his wife Rebeccah and son Jacob to bestow the blessing on the someday named "Israel" instead of the hairy eldest, Esau.
	  
	  Since my own childhood, I have spontaneously rooted for the underdog. Did I see myself as a perennial underdog? Did it seem all the more magnificent when the undervalued prevailed?
	  
	  It seems related to an old adage that a parent loves each of their children in the way that they need loving at any particular moment. It was intended to defeat the claim of one child or another that they were the "favorite".
	  
	  Emma was the last child I sired. The baby, as it were. I am writing this memory, because this last of my children has been the subject of more anguish than any of the others. It is because she was special, I guess, in some way.

- ## Conception
  collapsed:: true
	- So much of her early life there was a swirling around me, a roller coaster of up and down. I spent lots of energy trying to re-vitalize a congregation. I spent energy throughout the week trying to nurture a step-son. He accompanied me to church on school days because he attended just across the street at the Catholic School. That lasted until it was time for middle school.
	  
	  Emma's mother seemed invested in a place almost an hour's drive away. Her "family" was in South Bend. We lived in Michigan City. She had made me promise when we married that I would not ask her to move away from her family. Her job was there. Her sense of who she was was wrapped up in the identity of work in a health-care setting.
	  
	  It was a rocky time in the marriage. From the beginning. She had begun asking for a divorce from 1992 onward. But then there were periods of calm, even ebullience. What was that about? I never knew.
	  
	  In such a space and time the news was dropped that her mother was pregnant. The context for me was that whatever comes in my life, my task was to make a blessing out of it. First do what it takes to make it work. Then my calling was to pour myself out in love and devotion. 
	  
	  Some of that may well have been that I wanted desperately to provide what my father had not. It was also that I already carried a keen sense of not being able to live up to the expectations I placed on myself. I had not done well at fathering my little brother, David. I had failed in so many ways at fathering the children of my first marriage, even as I had tried desperately at times to do the right thing. With these children, I thought, I will provide the love and nurture that will outlast and outshine all others.
	  
	  Bluster and self-delusion, I suppose.
- ## Birth
  collapsed:: true
	- I was determined to be present at the birth of Emma. I had been forced from the delivery/operating room with Lydia when the spinal block failed. My response wasn't exactly, "You don't know who I am." But something like, "You really don't know who I am." I knew of myself that I could take any amount of chaos and emergency and I would not faint and would not cause trouble. Of course, hospital protocol prevailed. But for Emma, I was determined that that wouldn't be repeated. 
	  
	  So I was present for the birth of 4 of my 5 children. 
	  
	  Nothing was unusual in the several days that it took for Emma's mother to recover. Then we prepared to head home. Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes. Mother in the mandatory wheel chair. Then off to the elevator. As soon as we entered a loud alarm went off throughout the floor -- perhaps the whole building. The doors froze and there was no going up or down. 
	  
	  A nurse had forgot to clip off the identification bracelet on Emma's ankle. That was my Emma.
- ## Fathering
	- When Lydia had come home from the hospital, Bridget seemed to have difficulty knowing what a mother was to do. I felt like Mo had taught me something of that and I tried to step in. Perhaps Bridget resented me for that. I was something of a "La Leche League" coach for her. Encouraging her in ways that I had learned from earlier experiences. I "mothered" Lydia in significant ways. I was the one who could quiet her at night. I took pride – that's an observation to be wary of – being able to sooth her at night, put her to sleep in my arms, comfort her when nothing else or no one else could accomplish it.
	  
	  Emma was a different story. Her mother was a little more confident in her ability to nurse. I now needed to pay even more attention to Lydia as Bridget was focused on her new-born. I felt an inner pressure to open my heart to Emma in compensation for the extra time I spent with Lydia. It was right and proper that Emma's mother be the primary care-giver at this point.
	  
	  And so it was that I began what I thought would be an innocent time of fathering and nurturing two little girls. They shared a bedroom then. Emma in a crib and Lydia in the "big girl" bed. I solidified my deepest intention to be the best father ever. I thought I knew deep within that I could do it by growing a love within me like an oak tree or baobab tree. I read, I fed, I rocked, and read stories. Lydia seemed to naturally melt into my arms after only a few minutes of rocking. Emma, on the other hand, seemed to demonstrate a "strong will" from the beginning. When she was upset there seemed to be now way to get past it with gentleness. She would fall asleep after she was exhausted. Again and again.
	  
	  I changed diapers and gave them baths. I was conscious of being a male in a female dominated family. I was ultra-sensitive to gender issues as related to privacy and appropriateness. This was made especially present to me as it was during these years that the church was increasing at great speed it's awareness of and sensitivity to abuse issues. From the beginning of my marriage to Bridget I was aware that my approach to relationships was vastly different from hers. The differences were manifest in the way we approached parenting. I was utterly committed to a mutuality and sharing of parental roles. My sense was that Bridget [[Bridget]] was far more committed to traditional roles of fathering and mothering.
	  
	  Does it make any difference so many years later that both my mother [[Mom]] and my brother [[Bill]] thought that Bridget and I were mis-matched and inappropriately wed? If I had known how skeptical they were in 1991, would it have made any difference?
	  
	  One little illustration of my parenting with Emma was a sort of game we had as I took her into her preschool. When I took her out of her car seat I would hoist her onto my shoulders and we would proceed into the front doors, ducking because with her height above me we didn't fit the doorway. How little I could have suspected where that little gesture would lead.

	  The insight that Lydia and Emma were each of them envious for what the other had.

	  There was some ambivalence about whether the *Priory* was the right school for Emma. It clearly was for her sister. Did she vacillate about going? I can't remember. Perhaps she wanted to follow in her sister's path. Perhaps she wanted to blaze her own trail. But I knew that her needs were very different from Lydia's.
