# 3-4 things I know

* All is grace
* goal of life is to say "thank you"
* God surprises us – not what we expect. That's his typical medium of communication
* One of the vehicles of that communication is **paradox** – cf. parabola
* influence of ancestors (mother-father) is huge
* Life is long enough to learn, but not really long enough to change
