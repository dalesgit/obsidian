It appears that authentication has worked while using vscode. 

One key was install gnome-keyring so that vs code could store info.

I used the icons in the active notification section to the left. 

I wonder if this may not be tied to the token at all -- so as long as I am working from within [[vs-code]] [[2022-09-20|notes.journal.2022.09.20]]?

Paste works with konsole. Shift/ctrl/v.
