* an enormous literature on the "early church" â€“ first 2-3 centuries.
* it has been inspiration for reform of the church from the Apostolic period, through the Reformation, up to present day America
* consensus that something changed in the transition of the 4^th^ - 5^th^ centuries. Call it Constantinian Church, establishment of Christianity, institutionalization of the Church in Rome,
* It is clear that in those early centuries the church was different.
