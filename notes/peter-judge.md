He and I shared at the symphony today about the struggles we have in retirement with basic questions:

- Why do I get up in the morning?
- What am I good for?
- Who am I -- without the trappings of our life's work?

I shared with him my hesitance and skepticism with the mystical optimism of Beethoven's 9^^th^^. He listened. Then at dinner I had an opportunity to point to "creating joy in the moment we find ourselves, with the stuff of our present moments." 

Peter pointed out that that was maybe my answer to the question I had asked (at the farewell concert in Charlotte, May 21)
