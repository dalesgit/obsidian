- # Birth and more
	- pain when the knife put to Bridget's belly. I was thrown out of delivery room -- she's the only one of five.
		- giving my best to coach and encourage Bridget in nursing. Wanting the best for Lydia. *La Leche League with Mo*
	- reading stories. She loved them.
	- holding her til she fell asleep
- # Michigan City
	- Kneeling in the grass to see living things.
	- Flopping in the mountains of leaves.
	- Father/Daughter dance. So proud. Thought her so beautiful. Disappointed that she was too shy or embarrassed to be with me, she wouldn't dance.
	- filming her concert at Kindergarten. So proud of her.
	- Passion for water -- Lake Michigan in the cold May weather. Dislocating shoulder when we were jumping in the waves. I felt so bad -- and left out of the healing as Bridget took her without me to hospital.
- # Move to Hawai'i
	- Singing Potters song as we drove to Hawai'i. Her sadness at leaving e.g. her substitute family, Ethan, Mama Sue.
	- Swimming in the pool at Hawai'i Kai.
	- Playing in the snow on top of Pikes Peak.
	- Connected with her 3rd grade teacher at Kamilo'iki. Special focus on writing -- Lydia knew about telling stories.
	- Learning to swim -- passion for water.
