## 1. Hit the beach

From picturesque [Poipu Beach](https://poipubeach.org/) in Koloa to tranquil Anini Beach on the North Shore, you could visit a different beach each vacation day without hitting them all.

Each one has unique treasures. Some may be better suited for snorkeling, surfing or simply soaking in the temperate, crystalline waters. You may even spot sea turtles and seals.

Most of Kauai's breathtaking beaches are free and [open to the public](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/occl/beach-access/), though a few, like [Ke'e Beach](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/kauai/haena-state-park/), are part of state parks, which charge nominal entry fees.

## 2. Take a hike

You can soak in Kauai's stunning scenery at your own pace hiking in state parks like [Waimea Canyon](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/kauai/waimea-canyon-state-park/), known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, and [Ha'ena State Park](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/kauai/haena-state-park/), home of the famed Kalalau Trail, one of the only ways to reach the island's iconic [Na Pali Coast](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/kauai/regions/north-shore/napali-coast) without a helicopter or boat.

Parks charge a $5 per person entrance fee and a $10 parking fee for nonresidents. Hawaii residents enter free with their state ID. Elsewhere on the island, you can hike free along places like the seaside [Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail](https://www.kauai.com/mahaulepu-beach-trail).

No matter where you go, visitors are urged to tread lightly and [leave no trace](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2021/08/03/national-parks-leave-no-trace-principles-environment-wildlife-crowded/8055942002/).

**Reservations required:**[To manage overcrowding, are reservation systems the future of tourism in Hawaii?](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/travel/2022/09/27/hawaii-travel-diamond-head-hanauma-bay-booking-reservations/10369565002/)

## 3. Go bird watching
You can see albatross and other seabirds rarely spotted on land at [Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/kilauea-point). If you're lucky, you may also see spinner dolphins or humpback whales, depending on the time of year.

The wildlife refuge also houses Daniel K. Inouye Kilauea Point Lighthouse, which served the island and kept sailors safe for decades.

There is a $10 entry fee and an additional $1 reservation fee for most visitors over the age of 15. Once a month, the wildlife refuge waives entry fees, but reservations are still required.

## 4. Catch a hula show

Expensive luau aren't the only place you can observe traditional hula.

## 7. Drink up

Hawaii may be best known for its kona coffee, but [Kauai Coffee](https://kauaicoffee.com/pages/visit-the-kauai-coffee-estate) is actually Hawaii's largest coffee grower. Coffee lovers can sample the company's 100% Hawaiian coffee and take self-guided tours for free at the Kauai Coffee estate in Kalaheo.
