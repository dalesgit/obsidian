- [[Memories]] as I am going to sleep. 

Remembering the time I was in the mountains. Age ca. 13. I remember [[Mom]] being diligent in supporting me in my "manly" efforts after the divorce. 

I was in the mountains. There was a stream and a few cabins. Someone lived there I think. YMCA? We went out on a raft. Playing in the river/stream. I slid off the raft and scraped a hole in my knee good. Lots of blood. I had to be tended to. But I remember the thought, "It's strange that it is so deep and bloody, but it doesn't hurt." 

I rationalized even at the time that perhaps that was the case because it had cut away nerves and thus no response was being sent to my brain.

I think of the times in Steamboat that I have remembered over the years.
