May 31: What did I add to my "markdown" folder(s)? It had to do with Ukraine and related subjects. It had to do with astronomical and archaeological learnings. [2022-06-01](2022-06-01.md)

[[abortion]] is one of those themes I consistently save in the markdown folder. [[gun-control]] is another that is on the nation's radar at the moment. [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) has been especially emotional about the Uvalde shooting -- a school and innocent children.

[[russian-invasion-ukraine]] is another of those subjects that I am interested in. I think it is because I perceive it to be a pivotal fight. At least on a par with the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939. 

I am flabbergasted that a human being like Putin exists. How does someone cause death and destruction and suffering on such a scale and not bat an eye? 

I similarly ask myself the same questions (at a smaller scale) with regard to [[desantis]] in Florida.

Guns issue is hot. The future task of digitizing color negatives is a "problem-solving interest, [digitized-film](digitized-film.md)".

[Florida](Florida.md) history is richer than I anticipated, with its deep roots in Spain, at various times multiplicity of languages, attraction for non "southerners." It's currently the 3rd most populous state.

One Oped made the case that has seemed so obvious to me for months, at least, that the Supreme Court judgment on Roe v. Wade [Abortion](Abortion.md) was based on [religion](religion.md) religious grounds not on legal, or -- most laughably -- historical or sociological grounds.
