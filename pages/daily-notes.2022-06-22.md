## Journal Entries
-  The wiring for internet at the house was the original wiring. Not suitable for use with internet in the year 2022.
- [learn](learn.md) and [create](create.md) I worked intermittently through the night and the day to get a suitable vim markdown viewer going. I abandoned the nvim effort -- which clearly is more streamlined than vim/gvim, but for my purposes not vastly better. I settled on the one I started with at the beginning of the day. 
- I have not [exercise](exercise.md)d for days.
- [Scott](Scott.md) contacted me, and then we talked a little bit. He wanted to check out coming down here. He will rent a car and take care of himself. But he is somewhat anxious. He assured me, "Loa is supportive." He will come no sooner than July 4^th^ so probably our furniture will have arrived.
- [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) was the driving force behind spending over $10K on furniture. One remarkable thing was watching the designer person at the store figure out that the way to furnish our house was by exchanging dining/family room. It has to do with how many walls you have to work with.  
- I am convinced that the [Abortion](Abortion.md) solution the current fascist government is putting forth is an abuse of the constitution prohibition from establishing a religion. The Maine judgment about state support for religious schools is another element in that appalling development in the country. 
- Folks like our generous host here, Martha Shrader, do not understand that treacher afoot, or the real danger to the life we are facing. It is not a Democrat/Republican thing, or even a democratic/socialist thing.

## Gratitude
- For the generosity of Mike & Martha, even as both MP and I struggle with wanting out of here. I want to leave before their resentment kicks in, before both of us are hardened against the other couple.
- Grateful for the positive discernment both MP and I felt in the spending of lots of money.
- For the opportunity to see "Tony" at the furniture store come up with a way to re-imagine what we wanted in our new house.
- Also the delight (Nobody paid attention to) that Tony was using the same software as I was using that MP had such trouble with.
