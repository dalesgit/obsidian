- What dreams did I create last night?       			
- Where did my eyes linger today?
- Where was I blind?
- Where was I hurt without anyone noticing?
- What did I learn today?
- What did I read?
- What new thoughts visited me?
- What differences did I notice in those closest to me?
- Whom did I neglect?
- Where did I neglect myself?
- What did I begin today that might endure?
- How were my conversations?
- What did I do today for the poor and the excluded?
- Did I remember the dead today?
- Where could I have exposed myself to the risk of something different?
- Where did I allow myself to receive love?
- With whom today did I feel most myself?
- What reached me today? How deep did it imprint?
- Who saw me today?
- What visitations had I from the past and from the future?
- What did I avoid today?
- From the evidenceâ€”why was I given this day?
