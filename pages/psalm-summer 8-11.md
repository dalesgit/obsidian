### Psalm 130

*De profundis*

1 Out of the depths have I called to you, O Lord;  
Lord, hear my **voice**; *  
let your ears consider well the voice of my suppli**cation**.

2 If you, Lord, were to note what is done a**miss**, *  
O Lord, who could **stand**?

3 For there is forgiveness with **you**; *  
therefore you shall be **feared**.

4 I wait for the Lord; my soul **waits for him**; *  
in his word is my **hope**.
