I am so grateful for his support. He reports that he considers it a good idea to share with Lydia and Emma the biography I produced and shared with mom and Dick Hubbard initially, as well as some emails from the "aughts" that reveal the deep history of the relationship with [Bridget](Bridget.md). I think he is right and that it would have to come from him and not me.
