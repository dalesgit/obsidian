	  One of the parishioners at St. Paul's remembered my sermon about Miriam's baptism – asking if Amy was the daughter I "wok'd". I am humbled.
	  
	  Lydia reported that Nick made her "feel good about myself."
	  
	  Preached at Great Falls and Monroe. There was a real congregation at St. Peter's. St. Paul's felt magnificent in the garden. Lots of people contributed to making the garden work.

	  Today I pulled out Mom's knit afghan, intending to fix it or get it fixed. And to give it, I think, to Miriam. But maybe Lydia?
	  
	  Tonight I saw the space station make its transit across the sky. In the back yard from just above the fence to disappearing in the clouds of the eastern sky. Mary Pat wanted to include and be with Sean.
	  
	  Meeting with the WU department, Takita mistakenly described me as having a "terminal degree", and so qualified. Peter reiterated that I was qualified to teach the courses, as if he was trying to camouflage that I didn't have that degree. The department has depended on me adding to their statistics for the University. They are so small and weak.
	  
	  I got so much working on the faces of the 2 computers that failed on me last week. I recognized that's why I missed some emails.
	  
	  That, and I had some success with trying to preach Easter.
	  
	  Julian and Lydia have called to thank us for the money. Miriam, I think may not recognize it yet, for whatever reason.
	  
	  In reflecting with Mary Pat on the Department's being in an Interim interim position and jockeying for where it's headed, noting that I am important to them, I said they have no purchase on me, no leverage with me. I can say, "No thanks at any time."

	  It was like a dream turned into a nightmare. We watched 2 episodes of *Outlander*. Geillis and Jamaica, White Witch, and jewels. And love is in the air. I went off to pee. I assumed MP went too. Then when I emerged, I heard sounds. Sounds that were like moans or groans. I didn't know what it was. I saw the closed bathroom door. So I opened it, asking is anything wrong. But it was Sean. Peeing. Evidently singing cause he happy. He stated, "No, I'm fine."
	  
	  But I wasn't fine for seeing him there. I expected to see Mary Pat. I didn't expect anything to be wrong, but I've trained or rehearsed responding to her calls for help. Someday it will be important.
	  
	  And instead it was him! Ugh. You've overspent your welcome. You're not living in reality, Dude.
	  
	  Last thing tonight, she was doing a "Poor me" rendition and said, "You'll be happier with me gone." All I was trying to do is put a limit on how much TV I watched. She said, "Sometimes I just have it on. Probably when I'm gone you won't have the TV on at all."
	  
	  That's true. I hope we get to a place where that's OK with her. It's OK with me, but not her, I think.

	  I haven't recorded that the information was reported to me for the first time in counseling session yesterday was that Sean will not be staying at the house while Mary Pat is gone. In the session she tried to bring back the accusations that I hated Sean and rejected him and she would never do that with my children, and blah, blah, blah. All of it not true and beside the point.
	  
	  So today I meditated again and again on Sean not being able to deal with me. I had assured that there was no problem there. MP said that she had objected to Sean doing that, but "it's his decision."  There is just so much that is not acceptable to me.
	  
	  So, now at the end of the evening, he's going to move out. I intend to change the code on the garage door. Mary Pat is going to concentrate on family and grieving issues. Janet has assigned us to concentrate on "**dating**" behavior. It's not really clear to me what that is. "Focus on hope." "The kinds of things we did when dating and getting to know one another." Flowers. Little notes.

	  46 min. talk with Bill. He says that next week David & Laura are meeting up at their place. Then will travel to CA. David has inquired with Mary and Charlotte about possibly moving to Albuquerque with Laura. They said that if he did that he could **retire**.
	  
	  Sam (of Lee Detwiler) is transferring to Santa Fe – bringing with a bunch of friends (wealthy). Santa Fe is 6 hours or so drive for them.
	  
	  Bill reports that Feds are requiring a PIN of everyone? Just like Sean was saying?
	  
	  Bill wonders about Miriam. Figures Owen is just non-communicative as usual.
	  
	  Touched base with Wendy who will be Eucharistic Minister with me. She suggested a time to address the gun violence that touches us ...
	  
	  Gave scooter to Ehab Hamed (for Duha). When I asked, he seemed delighted when I told him how I would pronounce his name – he said, "You said it exactly right." but apparently it's problematic around these parts. He's called "Eee" at work.
	  
	  ---
	  
	  Probably the most important thing from Bill's phone call was something Bill said, acknowledged. When I asked him about the children and their relative lack of responses, among the things he responded with was about Emma. He said that he and Karla had had recent conversations about the fact that Emma had mentioned at the time of her wedding that she hoped there would be a time soon when there could be a proper celebration. Bill was conflicted about that in as much as he felt that he couldn't go if I was not invited. Karla, on the other hand, did not see Bill's point of view at all.
	  
	  I recognize their 2 perspectives as reflecting where they have been in phone conversations with me.
	  
	  It makes a difference that Bill wants to be "on my side." On the other side, I don't see how anyone could see that it's ok for me not to know what the accusation against me is. And thus unable to mount a defense or a counter-narrative, or just to provide evidence that it wasn't true.

	  Anne Lamott
	  Yesterday at 2:19 AM  ·
	  It’s not every day a girl turns 67. I never thought I’d see 18, and then 21, and then 30, and then fifty! Half a century old. 17 years ago. And now here I am on Medicare, married two years ago to the coolest guy, with feet that hurt almost all the time, a mind that scares me with its increasing forgetfulness and snags, and a heart so filled with love some days that I feel like a moony teenager and probably should not be behind the wheel.
	  Other days, not so much.
	  
	  It’s frustrating to lose cognitive function, and for everything to ache the day after a hike. I take some medicine at night but ten minutes later, I can’t be positive if I took it or not, and I have to compensate in a dozen ways for my constant distraction. I got a car five years ago designed for people who probably should not be driving. It has Keebler elves hidden behind the dashboard that beep when I am about to hit another car, or when the car in front of me has moved. The elves wipe at their forehands at each near miss.
	  
	  This is SO not who I am. You’ve got to believe me. I was the smartest girl in my algebra class junior year. I was a tennis champ. Now when I get out of bed in the morning, I limp around like Walter Brennan, and then I limp around off and on all day trying to remember what I am limping around looking for. There’s a story in the new book about accidentally taking the dog’s medicine, which was banned for humans by the FDA. I called the vet and sad, “Oh, I’m sure you get this all the time.” She said No, not really.
	  
	  Yet this might be the happiest I’ve ever been. The original title of Dusk Night Dawn was The Third Third, about the great blessings of being older—the self-forgiveness, the grace of myopia, of not seeing everyone’s flaws so clearly, the pleasures of a much quieter life, of slower and more attentive walks. But more than anything, the great blessing, the reason for my deep faith in life and God, is the minuet of old friendships.
	  
	  As John Merrick, the Elephant Man said, “My life is full because  know that I am loved.” That is exactly and 100% my truth. I learned in the third third of my life that love is all there is, that we are Love with skin on, that Blake was right when he wrote that we are here to learn to endure the beams of love. Love can be hard. We’re good at hard.
	  
	  I wrote in the new book, “Love is gentle if sometimes amused warmth for annoying and deeply disappointing people, especially ourselves. Love is someone who will draw near when you cry. Love plops in front of the TV with a bowl of popcorn and you. Love plops but love also flies. Love reveals the beauty of sketchy people like us to ourselves. Love holds up the sacred mirror. Love builds rickety greenhouses for our wilder seeds to grow. Love can be reckless (Jesus is good at this), or meek as my dog, or carry a briefcase. Love is the old man in the park teaching little kids to play the violin; much time spent tuning, the children hearing their way into the key he is playing. Love tiptoes and love lumbers like an elephant, it naps on top of your chest like a cat. It gooses you, snickers, smooths your hair. Love is being with a person wherever they are, however they are acting. Ugh. (A lot of things seem to come more easily to God.)
	  
	  My life is full and I am grateful to the point of tears on my 67th birthday because I know I am loved. I just wanted to share that with you.

	  To Miriam, who asked if she could share her gift with Emma.
	  
	  > It was a gift. It’s not a gift if it comes with conditions, that would be an exchange. I’m working hard these days at not triangulating. Emma has harshly rejected every effort I have made even to make contact to say nothing of having a relationship. Nevertheless she would have received the same check as you if I had any contact information that would’ve made that possible.

	  *Hemingway* by Ken Burns. Watching the first episode. I am personally drawn in. He grew up in Oak Park. Father a physician. Was it mother who used to talk about him?
	  
	  He said, "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know." I have this sense that I have been doing some of that in these last years of my life. That I am doing it even now. writing
	  
	  It reminds me of my mantra about preaching. "Seek to speak in complete sentences." But also, seek for that leadership of worship where people will say, "I'm glad I was here." So many people when I share those thoughts don't seem to understand.
	  
	  ---
	  
	  The end of one of his short stories (read by Edna O'Brien) goes, "... please, please, please, please, please (I don't know how many) stop talking." The speaker a woman who has been talking with her lover about having an abortion.
	  
	  It was striking to me, because I had just hung up the phone with Mary Pat. She had tuned me out when I had just got going, passionately talking about Linux and WU. But she had tuned me out. As if she spoke those words. And in the context of the story, where Edna O'Brien clearly hears that *pathos* of the woman, I ask myself, "What do I need to hear about myself in this?" How am I being self-centered? Only concerned with my vantage point, and missing the really important stuff?"
	  
	  I don't know.

	  This is where Bezos shares a simple, brutal truth that so many people never learn, before using the remainder of the letter to make his case that Amazon actually lives up to this ideal.
	  
	  The five words? "[Create more than you consume](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders?tag=wwwinccom-20)."
	  
	  Here's the context:
	  
	  > "If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn't create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn't long for this world. It's on the way out."

	  *Sometimes, Always, Never*
	  Bill Nighy and Marmite
	  
	  12 July 2019 | by backofthevan – See all my reviews
	  
	  I will watch pretty much any film with the wonderful Bill Nighy. Just watched this one and not sure what I think of it. His character, wildly knowledgeable when it comes to Scrabble, was 100% wrong when he stated that Marmite is banned in Canada. No, my friend, it definitely isn't. I have a jar in my own cupboard. I actually had to have a look and confirm that it is, indeed, Marmite, and not the poor substitute Vegemite (which he claimed was the only option for Canadians). Marmite has been available here for at least 10 years and, since the film obviously takes place in the present, he was just plain wrong.
	  
	  Now I'm thinking that if the availability of Marmite is my lingering thought after seeing this film, how memorable was it? It DOES meander, as others have said. It DOES try awfully hard to be visually quirky to the point of being absurd at times. It does convey somewhat the damage done to people when someone they love goes missing. There's no closure; they spend their lives from that point on grieving, wondering, blaming, searching and, likely, never really having a carefree moment again. That was certainly brought home to me in all its sadness. If you need cheering up, this is not the film for you.
	  
	  Is this a vitally important film? No. Not even sure why it was made. It's like reading a short story, which is what it was based on, finished in 90 minutes or so and easily forgotten.
	  
	  A small film about big topics that balances an overarching feel of sorrow with heavy doses of whimsy. Eloquent both visually and emotionally, it speaks volumes about heartbreak even when the characters can't quite find the words to do so themselves. (Richard Crouse)

	  Sean,
	  I regard you as essentially a coward. You are unable to be honest. You  are essentially manipulative and intent on doing your own self-interested purposes. Ah, you would like to proclaim to the world that you are altruistic and looking out for others. Trying to serve others' interests. Your refusal to engage me these past few weeks was all about trying to cater to my needs. Give me a break. You haven't a clue as to my needs. You don't have the courage to be a true healer, a true breaker o f the bonds. You are a con from the get go.

	  From Mary Pat and read to me in couples counseling session 4/28/21.
	  
	  Dale:
	  
	  You have said that I have changed, and our relationship has changed, since Sean came. I agree that I have changed; a lot of events have caused significant change, even before last summer.
	  
	  Three years ago I had foot surgery that left me essentially an invalid for most of the year, very dependent on you for everything. Only recently have I felt completely back to normal; driving Sean to and from work was a positive influence on my independence. It may have seemed like I didn't need you anymore; I certainly didn't need you in the same way, but I always need your love and affection.
	  
	  • Two years ago I retired, after almost 50 years of teaching. That was a huge change. At first we traveled a lot, to Hawaii, to Ohio, to Florida, and I didn't miss teaching so much.  Then I was hired to do professional development with teachers, and that was interesting and fulfilling. COVID shut that down. I still haven't found my purpose, as many of the things I had thought about doing after retirement were blocked by COVID restrictions.  Perhaps I threw myself into Sean's rehabilitation more than I should have. I never meant to exclude you; in fact I looked forward to working with you to provide the assistance he needed. You have knowledge and experience in working with addicts and in the past had been very supportive and caring when it came to Sean.
	  
	  • My mother's health went into a steep decline in fall 2019, and worry about her and uncertainty about what I could do occupied me for the next 15 months. Now she is gone, and it was such a blessing to be able to be with her at the moment of death. The time I spent with my siblings this month was really wonderful. It reinforced my understanding of family. Mom and Dad taught us to love one another, and the people we introduced to our family (friends and lovers), to try hard to understand and accept each other especially when we disagree, to work out our differences even if it just means to agree to disagree. That has always been my understanding of family, and it's the relationship I want to have with you and with all the people connected with you.
	  
	  • Since the beginning of our relationship, 10 years ago, it has been the two of us. We did almost everything together; you even went to math conferences. Suddenly last summer we opened our home to another person. Certainly that changed things for all of us. We did not have children together, but this could be an opportunity to co-parent in our old age. I am so sorry if I misunderstood your reservations about inviting him to come in the first place, and if it seemed I was excluding you in any way. Sean will be with us a while longer. I don't see how we can throw him out; we committed to the Parole Board to provide him with a place to stay until he could live on his own. How can we work together for the next few weeks or months to reconnect with each other and work together to support Sean in his recovery?

	  conflict Yesterday, MP could not think of anything that I could do that would please her. I emphasized that I was suggesting something small and limited. I thought, "How wonderfully "Catch 22" of her – there's nothing I can do that would satisfy her." Finally she came up with, "Put breakfast dishes in the dishwasher – don't leave them on the counter."
	  
	  I am so offended, after all the dishes I've done over the years, how thoroughly I clean the kitchen when I do it, and that's what she finds to be irritated about.
	  
	  I think that all I am to her is **irritations.** My hair on the carpet. She washes my clothes – but she was furious when I set about to do my own laundry. She imagines that her efforts are all that keep this household going.
	  
	  **I'm ready to give up.**

		- ## Insight:
		  
		  Mary Pat has had an interest in maintaining that the issue between us was Sean. Going back at least to the time during prayer when she asked me when I was going to forgive Sean. As long as she maintains that I "hate" Sean, she has the high road to an impregnable case against me. But she has also been the one to argue that the conflict between us pre-dates Sean so that it isn't "Sean's fault."
		  
		  Strange bedfellows or some such metaphor.
		- ## Further broken trust:
		  
		  I have wondered over the past day about the money we had agreed that Sean would pay for room and board. I asked where the money was. She responded that he hasn't paid anything – she wanted to launch into a self-justification that he had wanted to pay cash but she didn't want that  – but I cut her off, saying I just wanted information.
		  
		  It should be something like $5,000.00. But my only serious request has been ignored.

	  I thought I might try to find the words to express your vital place in my life. There may not be anything I say here that is surprising to you. Then it's only a useful exercise for me. Some of what I want to say I have taken for granted that you knew. I could be wrong. I have been wrong about so many things in my life. Many times my instinct was right. Too often, I think, my stamina wasn't vibrant enough.
	  
	  I think of how I responded to the two times I took leader falls while rock climbing. Each time my rope and anchors held and the person “on belay” caught me — it might have been Mark Jansen on both occasions. In his adulthood he has suffered from debilitating mental illness. My response was to become more and more afraid of rock climbing, and of falling generally, that eventually I couldn’t do it at all. I went from the fearlessness of youth to continually telling myself “I am a coward.” It wasn’t true, of course, but became a linchpin for my ability to go into uncomfortable settings and do what needed to be done. Sometimes grace was palpable. Sometimes not. But it was always real.
	  
	  My determination not to have children seems connected with those inner messages. It started with a strong determination not to have children. Various decisions ensued that felt to me like the "cowardice" I told myself about my climbing experience. Then in the time it takes God to wink an eye, I found myself in the delivery room. I had been utterly wrong about the decision not to have children. As Chesterton said of Christianity: "The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried." So much I didn't know. It had been a challenging time during delivery. Obviously your mother had to endure things I would never have to go through myself, except in so far as my empathy could carry me there. We didn't know the gender. The cry. Then the doctor asked, "What's his name?"
	  
	  I cried and cried and cried. I had not cried for years at that time. I had accepted the criticism of others that perhaps I wasn't able to cry or express emotion. Then like a river bursting its banks, through a wash of tears, I responded, "Owen".
	  
	  I can not begin to relate to you how many times I have looked back on those tears of joy. I cannot tell you how many times over the years I have related to others that experience. Often the words have been cathartic for the person who heard them. They broke a logjam to be sure. They were a healing from hurts that went back probably to the general time that my parents divorced. When I sat in the waiting room of a hospital, a great-grandmother who had just lost another family member to a dramatic death, the other pastor, a Buddhist priest, on the other side, and I didn't know what to say or how to respond, those tears showed me the way. Somehow the words I would choose would prove inadequate, but I remembered the tears. Love would prevail.
	  
	  So many are the ways that your birth saved my life. Try to count the times you have gone ahead and done the things you said to yourself you couldn't do. It's at least that many times.
	  
	  > What thou lovest well remains,
	  >
	  > the rest is dross
	  >
	  > What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
	  >
	  > What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage (Ezra Pound *Canto 81*)
	  
	  He wrote this after the catastrophe of the 30's and 40's and his calamitous part in the history of fascism, for which he was imprisoned and caged like an animal.
	  
	  After leaving the darkness of the madness of silence, in his final years he wrote:
	  
	  > Can you enter the great acorn of light?
	  >
	  > but the beauty is not the madness
	  >
	  > Tho my errors and wrecks lie about me.
	  >
	  > and I cannot make it cohere
	  >
	  > If love be not in the house there is nothing,
	  >
	  > The voice of famine unheard. (from *Canto 116*)
	  
	  Your birth, those tears, helped me to understand in ever deeper ways. When I first read Pound in my early 20's, I knew his words resonated somehow deep within me. There was a longing perhaps. But you, Owen, allowed me learn something about love. You taught me deeply and to the quick. Not that I haven't loved others since, and recognizing that I didn't know how I had loved your mother until you were in your teens, I date my entrance into love to the time of your birth. Those tears at your birth have shown me the way through the decades of my life. "The errors and wrecks lie about me" to be sure. But I have done some things well. I could not have done them without you. You showed me that I could.

		- ## Reflection from *Give us this day for today*
		  
		  > I can really relate to her passion. To her bewilderment. I learn that perhaps I need to identify with Jeremiah in a way I never have before.
		  
		  **An Invitation Confirmed**
		  
		  “Macrina,” the Lord said one day, “I haven’t heard an Amen for a long, long time.”
		  
		  “No more Amens from me, Lord,” I answered. “I can’t say Amen to dead and crumbling leaves, to blood poured out, and broken, ugly things. It’s obvious I’ve made a mistake, a wrong choice. I’m taking my baptism back.”
		  
		  “Macrina,” the Lord said again, “you didn’t choose me. I chose you. And I’m not taking your baptism back.”
		  
		  At that moment my frightened, wintered heart remembered Jeremiah, and I bowed my head and prayed, “Jeremiah, I identify with you in your lament to the Lord. I, too, feel duped! (Jeremiah 20:7-9) Somehow He’s got the best of me and I can’t get away. I’m standing here with my baptism in my hands wondering what to do with it. . . . I don’t know what to do with such demand or such love. But it’s too late. I’ve already accepted. I walked around a long time with that invitation in my heart before I said my Amen. But then one day I confirmed that invitation. I said yes to everything that God and the Church and all those faith-filled people who love me were asking of me. . . . [Now] I stand here not only with my baptism in my hands, but confirmed and fed and healed as well. God has hold of me and I can’t get away. I feel forever compelled to carry within me, and live out of me, these signs of God’s love. Yes, Jeremiah! We must be twins. There’s a fire burning in my heart too. And it’s stronger than the fear.”
		  
		  So once again I find myself proclaiming: Amen, my Lord, Amen!

		- ## Reflection
		  
		  **Joy and Peace—Whatever Happens**
		  
		  *And when Jesus had said this, he said to Peter, “Follow me.”*
		  
		  It seems to me that I have greater peace and am close to God when I am not “trying to be a contemplative” or trying to be anything special, but simply orienting my life fully and completely towards what seems to be required of a man like me at a time like this.
		  
		  I am obscurely convinced that there is a need in the world for something I can provide and that there is a need for me to provide it. True, someone else can do it, God does not need me. But I feel He is asking me to provide it.
		  
		  At the consecration of my Mass I suddenly thought of the words: “If you love me, feed my sheep!”
		  
		  The wonder of being brought, by God, around a corner and to realize a new road is opening up, perhaps—which He alone knows. And that there is no way of traveling it but in Christ and with Him. This is joy and peace—whatever happens. The result does not matter. I have something to do for Him and, if I do that, everything else will follow.

	  Among her sisters, Rita stood out for her extraordinary spirit of obedience. In a test, her superior ordered her to water and care for a dead vine in the garden. Faithfully she carried out her assignment each day. (St. Rita is widely invoked as a patron of hopeless causes.) ( From *give us this day* today)
		- ## Where We Stand
		  
		  “Comparisons are odious.” I first heard the saying when I was growing up, and I loved it. The quote reminded me that comparing myself to others often led to pain and anxiety. Whether I worried that others were better than me or had a false sense of superiority, the result inevitably felt “odious.” And yet I did it anyway. ...

		  Phone call with Bill-Karla. Karla related that the estrangement story goes round and round in our families. With re. hers that she and Karen knew that their step-mother Mary didn't like them. Or didn't like their mother. The 2 of them had been friends in high school.
		  
		  As to her father, there was deep estrangement, but Karla reported that what had made all the difference was that her father, twice a year, took her out to lunch and asked her what was going on her life. i.e. really listening. She kind of suggested that the rest of the time her father disapproved of Karla.
		  
		  alienation
		  
		  He reported that Owen came out pretty sweet financially with his surgery (various insurance payouts). He also observed that there is a nexus with Owen/Shirley/Bridget that leaves him cut off from much of the rest of the family – including Mo apparently. Shirley has given up communicating with David, and in her note to him commented that our mother had stopped being a good parent in 1959 (before David was born).
		  
		  He reports that Emma is now living in California. She is teaching in Sunnyvale (Silicon Valley) and living in San Jose. He thinks maybe teaching special ed kids? Karla has seen on Facebook that Emma now "has another degree."

	  In my dream there was Dad as present and alive as he has been since he was alive. I had just arrived in Hawai'i. I was traveling alone. My luggage was lost for the moment. Earlier there had been a strange figure, who was either stalking me or following me to protect me. He/it was just a head, sitting on the ground. I was with people in that dream, but we were traveling and it was church-related. I was with young people and we had gone to an orientation of some kind. But the "head" announced at the end of it that my ride was gone. We had traveled there in something like the Miata, belonging to someone else, I think, and that person seems to have abandoned me and my companion. family – fathers
	  
	  Later, then, I was in a conference center sort of place when who should appear before me but Dad. I wasn't shocked to see him, but my first instinct was to avoid him. Then I decided to approach him. He was cordial and not shocked – maybe a little surprised – to see me. He was familiar and friendly to me. It then appeared that he was traveling with Clark Crandall and someone else and that the men were with young people, women, but they didn't seem to be wives. I thought they were daughters.
	  
	  I had shared with Joe and Tami last night stories about MyFamily.
	  
	  * Carolyn
	  * Shirley's "my other was an alcoholic and a nymphomaniac" and her promise to Bill that she wouldn't do that.
	  * Shirley as the lynch pin of alienation in my family
	  * said that my father had committed the greatest outrage in my family, so while his effort to get custody was put forward as a "Helen isn't a fit parent" that wasn't the whole story. That had been in response to Joe/Tami trying to identify the source of Shirley's anger at my mom.

	  Dear Frank,
	  
	  I sent you the link to my sermons because of our friendship, thinking you might be interested. I would be happy to share it with the retired clergy or anybody else that might be interested. It is, again, <http://sermons-fr-hathaway.blogspot.com/>.
	  
	  I smiled broadly at your inclusion of the Koko Crater photo. My memories of my thrice-weekly discipline of climbing the crater is constantly with me. They help motivate me in my current efforts at spiritual/physical discipline, which includes a 3 mile walk every day. I generally listen to a lecture or blog. I am fond of "On Being" and "Poetry Unbound". I also continue to pay attention to a range of subjects connected with the courses I continue teaching at Winthrop. These include: Introduction to Religious Studies, Introduction to Scripture Studies, Modern Christian Thought, and Introduction to the Hebrew Bible.
	  
	  Along with the rest of humanity we have made huge adjustments over the last year plus. All of my teaching has been virtual since then. And my supply work has been creative and unlike anything we prepared for in seminary – back in what seems like an aeon ago. The request for my time as supply priest has increased substantially over the last couple of months, as more and more flexibility is available to the churches. I supply in the Diocese of North Carolina and in the Diocese of Upper South Carolina.
	  
	  Mary Pat retired from Winthrop University in the spring of 2019. That was the last time we saw you all and we did a good bit of travel on the mainland – all up until we didn't any more. March 2019. So we anticipate a slow return to traveling, and even today beginning to plan for a cruise in 2022. Mary Pat's mother died in February, and that has impacted us in both larger and smaller ways. My children are spread from Indiana to Colorado and the west coast. My oldest grand child is scheduled to graduate from college next year. The youngest just entered kindergarten.

	  Thanks again, Dale.
	  I had a chance to read some of these great sermons this morning. A team of us were at St. Paul's last evening to provide some pastoral care, in the wake of Jim's death. One of the presenters also quoted Simone Weil about the importance of paying attention as an expression of prayer and of love. The Holy Spirit is moving, or at least our minds and hearts are, in the direction of hope. Thank you for your considerable gifts and leadership as you walk with this congregation during this time!

	  Dear Bishop,
	  Thank you for your care-filled attention and response. I had the thought to send the link to my sermons during one of my daily walks. I began the respository after retirement when I realized that the best record of my life and thoughts was found in my preaching. The prompt to send the link to you was in the realization that any accounting or reporting of my ministry should at least include my effort to find the words to connect the gospel to the lives of the saints of God. Over the years I have earnestly tried to be faithful to that calling. I am grateful for and impressed with the abundant response you have given the people of St. Paul's. I am just a small piece in the huge community for which you have oversight, but you have shown a gracious attention, and I do hope to meet you one day. Thank you again.

	  Four agreements to live by: (From Steve Clyburn)
	  
	  1. Be impeccable with your word.....Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.
	  1. Don't take anything personally..... Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.
	  1. Don't make assumptions.....Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.
	  1. Always do your best.....Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.
	  
	  —
	  apropos of our discernment process re. St. Paul's
	  
	  NOURISH YOUR FAITH. STARVE YOUR FEARS.
	  
	  “You won't have to look for any signs when your soul is ready to step into a new chapter; they'll appear on your path at the perfect moment. You won't have to question whether or not you're going in the right direction; your intuition will have already confirmed that for you. You won't have to force a connection with your soulmate when they first arrive; you'll feel right at home. There's no need to panic when the Universe is your number one supporter. What's meant to enter your life will show up as naturally as your next breath. What's meant to stay in your life will conquer any obstacle to remain by your side. Your fear encourages the belief that you're not worthy of your dreams. Your faith encourages the belief that you're worthy of so much more. Do what's right for your spirit. Nourish your faith. Starve your fears.” - Esther T., The 50-Minute Course To Destroy Your Fears

	  'I Lost 70 Pounds After Applying The Advice From This Nutrition Book'
	  Lexi Tavares, as told to Emily Shiffer
	  
	  Wed, June 9, 2021, 8:00 AM·5 min read
	  
	  My name is Lexi Tavares (@healthydynamiclife), and I am 30 years old. I currently live as a digital nomad. I am founder and CEO of Healthy Dynamic Life. I read two nutrition and weight-loss books that changed the game for me, helped me switch to a plant-based diet, and change my outlook mentally too.
	  
	  For most of my life, I have been pretty fit. I grew up doing all sorts of activities, and I am very passionate about dancing. My mom shopped at the natural food store and made my family home-cooked meals. I considered myself pretty healthy.
	  
	  As I was growing up, though, I experienced body dysmorphia and disordered eating behaviors, as well as over-exercising. But I remember every day by lunchtime I would be so hungry I would end up overeating at lunch. Food controlled my life.
	  
	  Then, in 2018, I started gaining weight in a way that I never had before. As this was happening, I started to get super depressed. I would try to sleep as much as possible because I couldn’t bear to face myself or the world. I was relying on food as my source of happiness and pleasure.
	  
	  On top of being depressed, I was in constant physical pain. My upper, middle, and low back constantly hurt. My knees, hips, and ankles hurt. I had frequent stomach aches and gastrointestinal issues. I had migraine headaches. I had chronic respiratory infections and had frequent bacterial and yeast infections.
	  
	  My turning point came in February 2019 when my sister, who was living in Austin, Texas, invited me to come stay with her.
	  I was super excited to go visit my sister and lots of friends I had made when I lived in Austin about a year prior. But I realized that my friends in Austin had never seen me at this size before. I realized I had a huge motivation for myself to lose the excess weight I put on, and I wanted to do it as quickly as possible. But I also wanted to do it as healthily as possible.
	  
	  I had done *all* the fad diets before throughout my life. I would feel deprived, hungry, and end up gaining weight again. And I would get stuck in a cycle of restriction and bingeing. So I remained open to new, healthier approaches.
	  
	  One day, my mom recommended that I read the book Fit for Life by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond.
	  It took me a few days to read it, but it just made total sense. And after I read it, I decided that the next day I would start practicing their recommendations of:
	  
	  1. Eating fruit until noon (kind of a spin on intermittent fasting, without actually fasting entirely!)
	  1. Focusing on raw, whole foods until 4 p.m.
	  1. Properly combining the right nutrients for meals for easy digestion
	  1. Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day

	  We met Sean's "new family" at dinner last night. Then a KKK redemption story *Burden* tonight. Burden was his name but the notion of shedding your burdens was a part of the theme. It seemed throughout to integrate with Sean's story. [I didn't tell that to Mary Pat.] I did tell her about how I resonated with the part of Forest Whitaker (playing a Rev. David Kennedy) from Laurens, SC. shades of Bp. Kennedy's son, the betrayals he enacted at Holy Nativity in defense of the bishop – Bob Fitzpatrick. I said to Mary Pat that I had imagined a role something like David's if I had stayed in Hawai'i. I think +Bob even suggested it. ValuesofSociety

		- ## Drawing on Memories
		  
		  When I traveled to Japan in my early thirties, I began an adventure unlike anything I had ever experienced. I had been invited to help set up a new Catechetical Center for the Kyoto Diocese and knew no one there, not even the Maryknoll sisters with whom I would be living. Everything was new and different, affecting me deeply and inviting me to place my trust in God’s abiding presence.
		  
		  It was a significant challenge to live in a country in which Christians were a small minority. At the same time, I learned so much about the call to contemplation as I explored Zen Buddhist and Shinto practices. For the first time in my life, I was challenged to examine my Christian faith in more depth, experiencing both the “agony and ecstasy” Paul speaks of in today’s first reading. I recognized my own lack of faith and my defensiveness as I tried to share my beliefs. And yet, I remembered with delight that God was with me, leading the way. Drawing on these memories of God’s accompaniment throughout my life has brought me deep peace, especially during times when I am anxious or worried.
		  
		  The worries and anxieties of this past year are unlike anything most of us have ever experienced. Hard as it can be to do, it is important to remember God’s abiding love, to reflect on God’s care for all the earth and heed the invitation of Jesus to trust: “. . . will not God much more provide for you, O you of little faith?”

	  I learned from St. Mary's web page that Greg Holmes died in the Spring. Funeral 3/31. Video showed St. Mary's tentatively coming back together in the sanctuary. Small numbers. But there was : Bill, Jackie, Ruth, back Isamu's head, Bridget, Richert. Their priest seemed so loud and out of place. I'm glad if they're happy with it. It seemed mostly just sad. Pablo spoke.
	  
	  Greg was close to me in age. I think maybe he had diabetes or something. But still it struck close.
	  
	  At couple counseling I confessed to Bridget that children mostly made me feel sad, grief, loss. She said she understood, but I responded you don't.
	  
	  > it occurred to me even as I spoke that she does know something of it with so many years of Sean being lost to addiction. But she's now in the throes of his return – the Prodigal Son.

	  Oh, goodness, this quote just beckons me. And it is a part of the monthly rondo.
	  
	  > “The gaps are the thing. The gaps are the spirit's one home, the altitudes and latitudes so dazzlingly spare and clean that the spirit can discover itself like a once-blind man unbound. The gaps are the clefts in the rock where you cower to see the back parts of God; they are fissures between mountains and cells the wind lances through, the icy narrowing fiords splitting the cliffs of mystery. Go up into the gaps. If you can find them; they shift and vanish too. Stalk the gaps. Squeak into a gap in the soil, turn, and unlock—more than a maple—universe.”

	  imagery of Pacific northwest. Testament to friend's courage –leaving relationship. leaving with dreams that you have shared together.
	  
	  * **Catherine Massey**: 3 older school age girls in Charlotte. Julie Murdoch joining next month. part-time priest in charge Good Shepherd at Burlington.
	  * **Edmund Pickup**, 8  mos. St. Mark's @ Huntersville. Through Aug. 8. Leaving with spouse to Seattle, WA extended trip. Poem: endings are not just endings, but beginnings. Don't do fishing, golf, gardening, ... Church is the thing he loves to do. Looking to maybe traveling the country via Amtrak.
	  * **Susan Keedy**, Trinity Episcopal Church 3 1/2 years at?? Mount Airy? Fuquay Varina? (something Marina?). Fear that the cong. would just jump at the first candidate. But they were confident enough to say, "no". Moving on. On a long trek. Only now beginning to open up. Small space. Filling slots like ushers.
	  * **Jill Beimdiek**, 10 mos St. Pauls, Smithfield. Leaving end of Sept. Yesterday had conversation with CPG contact. Unkind, inflexible, conversations about returning to "normal". Altar up against the wall. They think of her as a functionary with a collar. 65 y/o. She's obviously discouraged. Planning on playing with paint in retirement. Remembering the negative implants "you are not a painter" from kindergarten. St. Margaret's convent, house in Ducksbury (sp.)
	  * **Darby Everhard**: St. Mary's at Highpoint. 9 mos. contract. It's been a good gig. 72 y/o. Living in Winston, NC.  22 year marriage. many grandchildren.  Beach vacations planned by her husband. Realizing it is difficult to leave places. She focuses on administrative issues. She needs to step back from doing this kind of work.
	  * **Patricia Grace**: St. Stephen's in Durham for 6 mos. In end-stage kidney failure. Looking at kidney transplant. 65 y/o. – looking at end of life. Interim is all about endings and beginnings. Looking at training for being "clergy coach". Long term neglect of congregation. Highly affluent. Come to "be served." Unaware of who they are and of the world in which they live. Hard to figure what to do in the course of a year. Big motivation to not make people angry, unhappy.  She's an administrative person like Darby. What can you do in a year. There's no there, there.
	  
	  **Catherine** seems to meet with congregations regularly, "listening sessions".
	  
	  Training tools, e.g. "DRIVE" a metric to find what energizes you and what drains you. Take a class to learn to think differently. Across the country "interims" are highly needed even if not valued. Catherine's colleagues having trouble to find the likes of us who are in the middle, ...  Perhaps look at "coaching" to support those who come in to follow the one's who left.
	  
	  **Susan** is shepherding the search committee – give answers that give insight into who the church, the nature of that congregation. e.g. that congregation is that they are "competent at being church."
	  
	  St. Francis Springs in Stoneville. (Greensboro) "Catholic Hilton". (used to convent food at St. Margaret's is satisfactory)
	  
	  **Susan**: Some congregations are bound to their problems, "stuck". Need more time and a trained intervention – more than a year. A year might give you time to work through "grief" – but more time needed to change?
	  
	  Leave a letter to the successor as you leave a congregation. **NB** List with bullet points of the problems?
	  
	  **Catherine**: This diocese for 10 years has had an approach to interim ministry that is short. That a reaction to interim ministry of 80's which was more "deconstruction". Now looking for people to walk along and put flags on the things to pay attention to. Feels "abrupt". Jill was coming into a place that had the longest serving rector in decades. Connecticut has gone **to no more interims** cause they can't find any.
	  
	  **Susan**: The church has always been in change. Rather we need to turn our face to the future. Stir up possibilities.
	  
	  **Darby**: We are all interims. Love them and move on to what God has called us to.
	  
	  **Darby**: help the vestry/congregation face issues that are going on. Honesty? Plant seeds.
	  
	  **Dale**: ask the question "Why should there be an Episcopal Church in this community?" **Patricia** has repeatedly asked this question to her congregation in Raleigh.
	  
	  **Walter Brueggheman**: when people are in special grief or pain, they don't have time for **The common Good**.  (**Patricia**) facing the question of times: meeting at 9:30 which is unpleasant for 8 o'clock folks as well as 10 o'clock folks.
	  
	  **Patricia** observed that good things happened during time of Covid. e.g. Old people doing Zoom. Projecting things on the wall.
	  
	  Next meeting Aug 19. **Ed** leaving to travel. **Darby** leaving.

	  What a development! I learned today that I had been removed from one of the courses that I had been planning to teach: Introduction to Reading Biblical Texts. No warning. I discovered it while preparing my syllabus. Immediately I knew that I could not teach my other course. I was done with Winthrop. Mary Pat  made the connection that my tenure with WU began bureaucratic bull shit and it was ending with the same. Kristin Kiblinger didn't respond to my obvious offense but rather to a defensive nonsense about why it happened.
	  
	  There is real relief at having WU suddenly lifted from my burdens. I have to navigate telling Greg and returning the key. But I'm done with that and so my life is simpler.

	  But how can we not speak?
	  
	  We are in the desert, a sacred place. It is where a group of former slaves was forged into a people. It is where Jesus rebuked Satan and refused to listen to his lies. It is where countless hearts have been purged of self-love as they traversed the dark night of the soul.
	  
	  We are in the desert, but in this place, too, the sower sows seed. Perhaps the parched desert soil will produce a rich harvest. We ask, not to tempt God, but because we truly do not know. What is this bread that God gives us to eat?

	  Kenyan runner Abel Mutai was only a few meters from the finish line, but got confused with the signs and stopped, thinking he had finished the race. BA Spanish man, Ivan Fernandez, was right behind him and, realizing what was going on, started shouting to the Kenyan to keep running. Mutai did not know Spanish and did not understand.
	  Realizing what was going on, Fernandez pushed Mutai to victory.
	  A reporter asked Ivan, "Why did you do this?" Ivan replied, "My dream is that one day we can have some sort of community life where we push ourselves and also  others to win."
	  The reporter insisted "But why did you let the Kenyan win?" Ivan replied, "I didn't let him win, he was going to win. The race was his."
	  The reporter insisted and asked again, "But you could have won!" Ivan looked at him and replied: "But what would be the merit of my victory? What would be the honor of this medal? What would my Mother think of it?" The values are transmitted from generation to generation. What values do we teach our children and how much do you inspire others to earn? Most of us take advantage of people's weaknesses instead of helping to strengthen them.

	  > From the first time I heard this it stirred something in my heart. Yes, there is a wildness to the Holy Spirit. The dominant images of the Holy Spirit are a meek dove or a flickering flame of a candle, both of which are in one way accurate. But the Holy Spirit is more than that. God’s Spirit is power and blows not merely like a gentle breeze but at times like a raging wind. Sometimes, this power makes us nervous. We like the idea of the Holy Spirit as a flame on a candle but a raging fire often causes anxiety. Our first instinct is to get it under control. It’s hard to control a wild goose; believe me, I know.

	  Blessed Among Us
	  
	  Paula González
	  
	  Sister of Charity, Environmentalist (1932–2016)
	  
	  Paula González, who was born in Albuquerque, entered the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati in 1954. After receiving a doctorate in biology, she went on to teach for many years at the College of Mount St. Joseph. A turning point in her life came when she saw the first photographs of Earth from outer space. It was the beginning of a new vocation in environmental ministry.
	  
	  In confronting the perils facing the earth, González realized it was not enough just to protest. It was necessary to demonstrate life-sustaining alternatives and to develop a new Earth-conscious spirituality. With the help of volunteers, using recycled materials, she converted an old chicken barn into a fully solar-powered and solar-heated house—“Casa del Sol”—which became her home. In 1995 she established EarthConnection, an environmental learning center on the grounds of her order’s motherhouse.
	  
	  At the same time, Sr. Paula tried to articulate a spirituality appropriate to our place in the cosmos. She spoke of God as “The Great Living One”—whose presence could be seen in all creation. Reflecting on the Our Father, she wrote, “When we proclaim God’s name as ‘hallowed’ (holy), do we recognize the echo of God’s name in the wonder all around us? Might God be calling us to be co-creators of a transformed earth, a heaven of peace and harmony?”
	  
	  She died on July 31, 2016.
	  
	  “ ‘Thy will be done’ has to be looked at in a new way: namely, that we maintain ecological community. In the end ecological kinship is the only valid way in which to pay homage to our Creator.”—Sr. Paula González

	  dream that I got to the altar at St. Paul's, and some folks (men) had decided that we were having wine that day and there were two flagons of it sitting on the altar. It was as if it were next Sunday. Unilateral decision that the church was going to be run by the "other" side.
	  
	  My response was the important thing. I was frustrated. Angry at the one-sided nature of the decision-making. Like when there was no communicating with Bridget or with Mary Pat. I have seen that side of the church. I've tried to do the right thing – **always**. But I think I've not very often succeeded.
	  
	  It feels a little, also, like the unknown, silent, behind-my-back stuff that threatens through the phone call about an investigation that is present as a recorded voice message on Mary Pat's phone. There was information that it was odd that any one would have:
	  
	  * Aloha and Mahalo
	  * an accent that seemed perhaps African or Middle-eastern
	  * a check from St. Paul's Church
	  
	  The struggle within me had to do with my own impotence to manage or respond. **There's a message for me in my ministry with St. Paul's**. This along with the overwhelming support I found at Christ Church yesterday and have found consistently at St. Paul's.

	  dream long and satisfying. I was in Hawai'i. I was in the church but also seemingly teaching stuff. I was going from place to place. Seeing people. Ruth Yoshioka was there and she was a friend, at least an ally. But maybe there was a cut, too. Mountains, snow on the mountains, a little like Colorado I guess. So maybe it was "home."
	  
	  I was getting ready for the classic travel dream, returning. But I wasn't at all sure that I was going to get on the plane. I was pretty sure I was going to stay, even though it was going to be expensive.
	  
	  It all seems somehow connected with leaving Rock Hill. Heading to a ministry that seems genuine – though clearly not easy as seems clear after my talk with Nicci yesterday.

	  I think of all of us out on the great waters of our recent history, being tossed about by the storms that swirl around us. \
	  However brave a crew we may be, there are ships among us who are lost and good people swept away. \
	  This image stays with me. It troubles me. \
	  Perhaps you understand where it comes from and perhaps it troubles you too. \
	  If so, then please join me in a shared vision today.\
	   I am praying for the waters to be calmed. \
	  For the storm to be stilled. \
	  For those in peril to be rescued. \
	  Throughout this day I am going to bring that vision to my mind, praying that the One who is able will bring peace to troubled waters. \
	  May every heart be joined in this simple but ever so powerful supplication and may all of our ancestors join us in the asking.

	  Tonight at dinner with Charlotte and Henry, I told stories:
	  
	  1. The principle of keeping church safe, is not easy and simple. But having a principle in mind allows for ... ? progress? There is the episode of Bridget's son and the Sr. Warden's daughter. But tellable story is of homeless person, mentally ill, her partner my drummer, she loved the liturgy. But she attacked Jane Oki. She was no longer welcome.
	  1. the ease of body in saying "no" to WU. But in contrast there have been times when I am defensive and my body reacts to precisely the thing I need to do but have resisted.
	  1. Lilly ?? and Elaine ?? suggested as Warden types. Scott, perhaps, as vestry. I asked the question who should recruit? Not clear.
	  1. Could we have a warden who refuses vaccine? I think, "No."

	  From my prayers tonight, world prayers
	  
	  Thanks
	  
	  BY W. S. MERWIN
	  
	  with the night falling we are saying thank you
	  we are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings
	  we are running out of the glass rooms
	  with our mouths full of food to look at the sky
	  and say thank you
	  we are standing by the water thanking it
	  standing by the windows looking out
	  in our directions
	  
	  back from a series of hospitals back from a mugging
	  after funerals we are saying thank you
	  after the news of the dead
	  whether or not we knew them we are saying thank you
	  
	  over telephones we are saying thank you
	  in doorways and in the backs of cars and in elevators
	  remembering wars and the police at the door
	  and the beatings on stairs we are saying thank you
	  in the banks we are saying thank you
	  in the faces of the officials and the rich
	  and of all who will never change
	  we go on saying thank you thank you
	  
	  with the animals dying around us
	  taking our feelings we are saying thank you
	  with the forests falling faster than the minutes
	  of our lives we are saying thank you
	  with the words going out like cells of a brain
	  with the cities growing over us
	  we are saying thank you faster and faster
	  with nobody listening we are saying thank you
	  thank you we are saying and waving
	  dark though it is

	  “It is not enough merely to exist. It’s not enough to say . . . ‘I do my work well . . . I’m a good churchgoer.’ That’s all very well, but one must do something more. Seek always to do some good somewhere. —*Albert Schweitzer*
	  
	  ...
	  
	  During the pandemic we witnessed the disastrous impact of those “hostile in mind” to public health protocols and mitigation efforts. We also saw hostility manifest itself in our unwillingness to listen to those with whom we disagree. Our collective aggression and division were on full display.
	  
	  In the face of this disunity, I am drawn to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s more helpful (if esoteric!) “esemplastic imagination”: **our ability as humans to take two concepts which do not coexist in nature and combine them into a new reality. Disparate things become part of a unified whole—the very definition of being “open in mind.”**
	  
	  As children our imaginations flourished, and anything was possible. As adults too many have allowed their imaginations to atrophy, giving way to cynicism rather than possibility. Jesus, lord of the Sabbath, reminds us to remain firmly grounded, holding fast to the hope of the Gospel. Peace is possible. Concern for the common good is possible. Nurture these possibilities. Jesus sustains our life, shows us the way, and will accompany us to eternity.

	  The most terrible nightmare. I'm awake now because this was going on for an hour it seemed. I was at a museum kind of affair. It was Hawai'i, but not a place that I knew. I was in the company of Bill Mok and family. I was estranged from my wife – I guess it was Bridget – but we were somehow together at this museum. But we got separated. I was with the Mok's. And the nightmare was that I couldn't do anything. My phone didn't work. Then I lost it. I lost the car. I was wrestling with the leftover things in the little place I was staying in. **I wanted to go home. But I couldn't**. I couldn't figure it out. I felt stupid. Then abandoned. I was on my own.

		  _“The insight we receive on the inner journey is that chaos is the precondition to creativity: as every creation myth has it, life itself emerged from the void. Even that which has been created needs to be returned to chaos from time to time so it can be regenerated in more vital form.”_
		  — Parker J. Palmer, author of *Let Your Life Speak* and founder of the [Center for Courage & Renewal](http://www.couragerenewal.org).

	  “Is the life I am living the same as the life that wants to live in me?”
	  
	  With this searching question, Parker Palmer begins an insightful and moving meditation on finding one's true calling.
	  
	  Let Your Life Speak is an openhearted gift to anyone who seeks to live authentically. The book's title is a time-honored Quaker admonition, usually taken to mean “Let the highest truths and values guide everything you do.” But Palmer reinterprets those words, drawing on his own search for selfhood. “Before you tell your life what you intend to do with it,” he writes, “listen for what it intends to do with you. Before you tell your life what truths and values you have decided to live up to, let your life tell you what truths you embody, what values you represent.”
	  
	  Vocation does not come from willfulness, no matter how noble one’s intentions. It comes from listening to and accepting “true self” with its limits as well as its potentials. Sharing stories of frailty and strength, of darkness and light, Palmer shows that vocation is not a goal to be achieved but a gift to be received

	  dream this morning, stretching on through several "dozes" was filled with the characters of my life. Paolo was mixed in with a colorful array of Hawai'i people. The place of the dream was clearly Hawai'i, but it seemed more like New Zealand, as if it was filled with the places of my life. There wasn't a deep frustration about getting home as in so many of my dreams, but there was the challenge of coralling all the personalities. When I woke up I couldn't stop thinking about John Egan. That led to goings on at Rensselaer.
	  
	  It came up by name during this week as I observed to Charlotte and Henry that the two institutions I was involved with – during the time I have called the happiest in my life – have gone out of business.
	  
	  I'm not a wizard at picking winners or a recovery specialist. But I think I have an ability to accompany folks on a spiritual journey – if they want company. I felt that empathy-piece when Kathleen started our conversation by talking about the death of their Great Dane. I ended up ad-libbing a response, since I didn't know what to say, but I wanted to build up Kathleen. My response had to do with the desire not to get older by growing a **thick skin** and, with her help, observed that sensitive artist type have an ability to live life more fully and thus to experience death more fully.

		- ## Shusaku Endo
		  
		  *Novelist (1923–1996)*
		  
		  The novelist Shusaku Endo, who was baptized as a child following his parents’ divorce, spent much of his life pondering the ambivalence and tension implied in his identity as a Japanese and a Catholic. He later likened his faith to an arranged marriage; he tried several times to leave, but something always held him close.
		  
		  After a trip to the Holy Land, Endo developed a deep love for the image of the Suffering Servant, despised and rejected. He believed this image of the Christ who made himself nothing, an image of maternal compassion in place of an image of power and judgment, was the image that might touch the Japanese heart. He expanded these reflections in the popular Life of Jesus.
		  
		  Endo is best known for his novel Silence, which tells the story of a Portuguese Jesuit in Japan during the time of fiercest persecution. After his own arrest and torture, he is forced to watch a parade of faithful Christians go to their deaths. To spare their lives, he is finally induced to recant and trample on a holy image, after hearing the voice of Christ tell him, “Trample! Trample! I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. Trample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men’s pain that I carried my cross.”
		  
		  Endo died on September 29, 1996.
		  
		  *“God is not a punishing God, but a God who asks that children be forgiven.”*

	  Oh, Ali,
	  This is like one of the most wonderful emails I've ever received. Your trust and honesty in sharing something of your story is a treasure and I thank you profoundly.
	  
	  In terms of your conclusions about things, I mostly agree with all of them. Your stubbornness and not fitting in – yep, check that. From the sounds of it I would say you have earned your conclusions in spades. Over the years I have watched my little brother be a model for me of a loving, kind, and thoughtful person. He's also either atheist or agnostic. He loves me and I love him. I've tried to generalize over the years, thinking at times that unbelievers are better at love than Christians. But I don't really think that's the case. I've known Christians who are profoundly loving and kind also. It's also clearly the case that Christians don't have a monopoly on violence, prejudice, and evil. At this point in my life I've decided I'm content to continue to try to be kind and love and to be a witness and force against violence, prejudice and evil. As long as the Christians accept me I'm good with that. At this point I don't think there's any other place for me.
	  
	  I heard an interview with Pete Seeger many years ago. He reflected on how most of the causes that he had stood up for and fought during his long life had ultimately been losing battles. He said that what was important to him was not the winning or losing but to have spent your life with the "good people" – by which he meant the people who were fighting for and against the right things. Love, kindness, against violence, injustice etc., that sort of thing. I sometimes remind myself of his words when I feel discouraged. Your story encourages me. When I see you in church it brings me a smile. Thank you.
	  
	  Faithfully,

	  This is the ending to movie *Radium Girls*
	  
	  The sisters had been fascinated by the Book of the Dead. This lines at the end (quoted above) seem to be in part taken from the opening of the Egyptian book of the dead.
	  
	  The **doors of perception** was what caught my attention. It is, first and foremost for me, from Aldous Huxley – cf. college days, and his experiments with **mescalin**. In reading about that I paid attention to the note that he suffered from **iritis** for many years.
	  
	  The metaphor itself is from William Blake.
	  
	  “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”

	  Yesterday's reflection in *Give Us This Day*. Mary Pat responded that this passage seemed intended for me. She seems focused on my un-settled, dis-ease, loss-of-focus, loss-of-self. I returned to the theme with Linda at Spiritual Direction. (cf. "Joplin" notes)
	  
	  > It was the Lord’s doing, not their own. It was the Lord’s power at work in and for them, which could do immeasurably more than they could ask or imagine (cf. Eph 3:20). It was sheer gift; it was grace.
	  >
	  > So is our deliverance from sin, as St. Paul reminds us in his Letter to the Romans. Of ourselves, we could never have broken the power of sin and death over us, but Jesus has done it for us. We are indeed raised from the dead, even now sharing in his eternal life. Nevertheless, sin continually attempts to ensnare us. On our own, we could never withstand it, but we can with the power of God’s grace. Our help is in the name of the Lord. We need only call upon him.

		- ## Blessed Among Us
		- ## Maura O’Halloran
		  
		  *Christian Zen Monk (1955–1982)*
		  
		  Maura O’Halloran, who was born in Boston and raised in Ireland in a large Catholic family, displayed from a young age a deep compassion for human suffering. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, she worked in soup kitchens and traveled widely in Latin America. Her concern for social justice was accompanied by a serious attraction to the spiritual life. After experimenting with various methods of prayer, she decided to explore the wisdom of the East.
		  
		  In 1979 she flew to Japan and applied for admission to a Zen Buddhist monastery in Tokyo, at the time rather a novelty for a woman in a very male setting. Her journals record her experience—sustained periods of meditation, manual labor, and an ascetic discipline of mind and body. After six months she experienced an ecstatic breakthrough, which her Master recognized as enlightenment. So impressed was he by her progress that he made an extraordinary offer—to entrust his monastery to her. But Maura did not believe this was her vocation. “I’m twenty-six and I feel as if I’ve lived my life,” she wrote. “Strange sensation, almost as if I’m close to death. . . . I’m totally content. Of course I want to get deeper, see clearer. . . . If I have another fifty or sixty years (who knows?) of time, I want to live it for other people.”
		  
		  After leaving the monastery she was killed in a bus accident on October 22, 1982. The publication of her journal brought a devoted following by both Christians and Buddhists. A small statue of her in the monastery in Japan is revered by many pilgrims.
		  
		  “*Suddenly I understood that we must take care of things just because they exist.*”—Maura O’Halloran

	  A week ago we learned about Maura O'Halloran at our daily prayer from *Give us this day.* She was a "Christian Zen Monk" who died prematurely and too young. I was so intrigued that I ordered a used copy of her journals and letters, *Pure Heart; Enlightened Mind.* When it arrived this evening, as I pulled it out of its wrapper, it fell open to a page. In the middle of the page I read:
	  
	  > "I made banana pudding. Tessan-san said, "What, no cake?" I pointed out the absence of an oven. The closest we could come was "hot cakey mix." He made a plump, delicious, greasy donuts. ... "Do you like jazz?" said Tessan-san. "Yes," said I, while thinking to myself, I'd like Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snot it uncannily was. Often, with very simple things like that, I think of something I want and it just comes. Strange.

	  Dear Emma,
	  
	  Would that there were words. Enough of them. The select right ones for the job. The job to reflect the loss of what never was. Of dreams? Perhaps. The last birthday gift I remember giving you was a kite ride above Honolulu waters. I don't know if you ever cashed it in. So many years now, I guess it doesn't matter. If there's a dream, now, I suppose it is that before I die you might walk into my room. So much gone.
	  
	  Hau'oli la hanau. Shalom, my beautiful girl. So bright and full of life.
	  
	  Dad

	  *Beyond Self: The False Self vs. the True Self*
	  
	  Thomas Merton claims that "the superficial 'I' is not our real self," but only our "individuality" and "empirical self," not the "hidden and mysterious person in whom we subsist before the eyes of God."20Thomas Merton, /New Seeds of Contemplation/ (Abbey of Gethsemani, Inc., 1961), This kind of thinking is found also in Keating and Pennington.
	  
	  Keating states that CP takes us to a place:
	  
	  "...in which the knower, the knowing, and that which is known are all one. Awareness alone remains. The one who is aware disappears along with whatever was the object of consciousness. This is what divine union is."21Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's
	  Monastery, 1992), 74
	  
	  
	  Keating and Merton both discuss the false self and the true self.  Keating capitalizes "Self," and states:
	  
	  "God and our true Self are not separate. Though we are not God, God and our true Self are the same thing."22Thomas Keating, /Open Mind, Open
	  Heart/ (Rockport, MA: Benedict's Monastery, 1992), 127 According to Merton, our "external, everyday self" is mostly a "fabrication" and is not "our true self" which:
	  
	  "is not easy to find. It is hidden in obscurity and 'nothingness,' at the center, where we are in direct dependence on God."23Thomas Merton, /Contemplative Prayer/ (The Merton Legacy Trust, 1969; Garden City, NY: Image Books Edition, Division of Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971), 70
	  
	  Buddhism teaches that our identities are merely fleeting images or impressions, like images on film, or a "sequence of happenings, of processes,"24Joseph Goldstein, "Exercise/ Easting" in Jean Smith, ed., /Breath Sweeps Mind: A First Guide to Meditation Practice/ (NY: Riverhead Books, 1998), 184

	  Blessed Among Us
	  
	  Gordon Zahn
	  
	  Peacemaker (1918–2007)
	  
	  Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Gordon Zahn was in most respects a traditional Catholic—except in his inability to reconcile the teachings of Christ with orders to kill his fellow humans. In 1942 he declared himself a conscientious objector, though no priest or bishop would support his stand. He was assigned to a work camp for Catholic conscientious objectors, supported by the *Catholic Worker*. Afterward he had trouble finding a Catholic college that would accept him. Nevertheless, he earned a doctorate in sociology and taught at several universities.
	  
	  In 1963 his book *German Catholics and Hitler’s Wars* showed how Germany’s bishops, through their general exhortations of loyal obedience to authority, had become instruments of Nazi power. This was followed by In *Solitary Witness*, which recovered the lost story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian peasant executed for his refusal to serve in Hitler’s army. Zahn’s work, including his personal lobbying, was influential in moving the Council Fathers at Vatican II to support recognition of the right of conscientious objection.
	  
	  Zahn worked tirelessly in the cause for peace, helping to found *Pax Christi USA*. In later years he suffered from Alzheimer’s—and thus was unable to recognize the significance of an invitation in October 2007 to attend the beatification of Franz Jägerstätter. He died two months later on December 9.
	  
	  “*All Christians, whether they realize it or not, have that vocation (in the full religious sense) of serving the cause of peace and, by logical extension, the obligation to oppose war.*”
	  
	  —Gordon Zahn

	  [[Journal] sending me an excerpt from *Naked Now* by Richard Rohr
	  
	  Thank you for this! Not only do I recognize this in connection with yesterday's conversation but I recognize it in my own life. The telling thing for me of what you said was, "There is no 'goal' (in spiritual direction), but if there was one, this is what it would be." Part of what is important in the relationship with Mary Pat is her memory of the teaching her priest gave her as she was discerning her own move to Hawai'i. The priest suggested the possibility that there wasn't a task to do there, but only "to be." As I have heard more than once, perhaps from Richard Rohr, that the goal is to accept that we are loved. There is, of course, a long tradition of seeing the goal as some kind of unity with God. In the counter-cultural ways of my college years, I persuaded a German professor to let me complete my language requirement with an independent study of Meister Eckhart. I did the same with one of my English requirements with an independent study of 14th c. English Mystics – that involved one of my tenderest memories of my father where he helped me photocopy an inter-library loan of the Cloud of Unknowing. The block plan at Colorado College allowed me to take a course in "Christian Mysticism" in the Wind River Range of Wyoming. A lot of this trajectory was influenced by memorizing large quantities of W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot. Most people would say, "What are you thinking?" It made sense to me then and is an important confirmation/memory now. Thanks.

Thank you for this! Not only do I recognize this in connection with yesterday's conversation but I recognize it in my own life.
