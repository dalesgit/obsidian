## Morning

<!-- Fill out this section after waking up -->
### Conversation with "Becky" Freidenburg. From Sept. 21st a message to Mia who found me:

The last 12 years have brought a lot of changes. Bridget and I divorced in 2012. That same year I retired from full-time parish ministry. I have been part-time serving in churches ever since. 2012 I started teaching at Chaminade University. I was in the Education Department but teaching a range of subjects to students from China, Micronesia, and the mainland as well as in Hawai'i. I remarried a woman, her name is Mary Pat, and in 2014 we moved to South Carolina where she had a position at Winthrop University. We had planned on moving to Florida after she retired but then Covid happened. The move was delayed while I was serving in several parishes. Finally we made the move this summer. Mary Pat is from Florida, and for me, Florida seems like the next best thing to living in Hawai'i. At the moment, anyway, I'm not serving in any churches and am fully "retired" in that sense. I don't know if it will last or not. Do you need a place to stay for a visit to Florida? Aloha, Shalom.

Father Dale!!! I don‚Äôt know if you remember me, but my mom (Rebecca) and I knew you back in Hawaii. My mom and I were reminiscing the other day about how kind and wonderful you are and it led to me wondering if I could find you online somewhere! I hope you‚Äôve been well, and I know my mom would love to get in touch if that‚Äôs okay with you üòä
#### Points of connection
- Pi'ikea has cut herself from her parents in the past year. It has been a healthy time of setting boundaries.
- She has 2 younger daughters (that are with David); oldest is entering high school
- She thought Bridget [[bridget]] was **toxic** from early on
- She experienced Bob as venal, shallow, and vindictive -- seen while serving on vestry at Good Shepherd, Maui; during a clergy transition. Bob the gossip, cut people down behind their back -- "liar"?
- She has been in continued communication with Bridget and Emma [[Emma]]. It didn't make sense to her that I was out of the picture.
- She said that I was a model Father for David & her.
- She said that Mia thought of me as a father figure
  
  I am aware that this experience has **reconnected me with an entire episode** of my life that I have been emotionally disconnected. It's not resolved or anything, but it is there. I loved Mia. I respected David and Pi'ikea. They respected me.
