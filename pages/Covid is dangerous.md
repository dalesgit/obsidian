Four years after what was once the “novel coronavirus” was declared a pandemic, COVID remains the most dangerous infectious respiratory illness regularly circulating in the U.S. But a glance at the United States’ most prominent COVID policies can give the impression that the disease is just another seasonal flu. COVID vaccines are now reformulated annually, and [recommended](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/annual-seasonal-covid-vaccine-shots-federal-regulation/672854/) in the autumn for everyone over the age of six months, just like flu shots; tests and treatments for the disease are steadily being commercialized, like our armamentarium against flu. And the CDC is [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/02/13/covid-isolation-guidelines-cdc-change/) considering more flu-esque isolation guidance for COVID: Stay home ’til you’re feeling better and are, for at least a day, fever-free without meds.

These changes are a stark departure from the earliest days of the crisis, when public-health experts excoriated public figures—among them, former President Donald Trump—for [evoking flu](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/09/10/all-the-times-trump-compared-covid-19-to-the-flu-even-after-he-knew-covid-19-was-far-more-deadly/?sh=6737c97f9d2f) to [minimize](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/13/21176735/covid-19-coronavirus-worse-than-flu-comparison) COVID deaths and [dismiss](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-ap-fact-check-anthony-fauci-flu-fe474f0c15f76adf324791a2cfc1e2bb) [mitigation strategies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/06/210000-deaths-later-trump-reverts-comparing-coronavirus-flu/). COVID might still carry a bigger burden than flu, but COVID policies are getting more flu-ified.

In some ways, as the population’s immunity has increased, COVID _has_ become more flu-like, says Roby Bhattacharyya, a microbiologist and an infectious-disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. Every winter seems to bring a COVID [peak](https://biobot.io/data/), but the virus is now much less likely to hospitalize or kill us, and [somewhat less likely to cause long-term illness](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/01/long-covid-dropping-risk-incidence/677183/). People develop symptoms [sooner after infection](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00005-8/fulltext), and, especially if they’re vaccinated, are less likely to be as sick for as long. COVID patients are no longer overwhelming hospitals; those who do develop severe COVID tend to be those made more vulnerable by age or other health issues.

Even so, COVID and the flu are nowhere near the same. SARS-CoV-2 still spikes in non-winter seasons and simmers throughout the rest of the year. In 2023, COVID hospitalized [more than 900,000 Americans](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_cumulativehospitalizations_select_00) and killed 75,000; the [worst flu season of the past decade](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) hospitalized 200,000 fewer people and resulted in 23,000 fewer deaths. A [recent CDC survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm) reported that more than 5 percent of American adults are currently experiencing long COVID, which cannot be fully prevented by vaccination or treatment, and for which there is no cure. Plus, scientists simply understand much less about the coronavirus than flu viruses. Its patterns of spread, its evolution, and the durability of our immunity against it all may continue to change.

And yet, the CDC and White House continue to fold COVID in with other long-standing seasonal respiratory infections. When the nation’s authorities start to match the precautions taken against COVID with those for flu, RSV, or common colds, it implies “that the risks are the same,” Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, told me. Some of those decisions are “not completely unreasonable,” says Costi Sifri, the director of hospital epidemiology at UVA Health, especially on a case-by-case basis. But taken together, they show how bent America has been on treating COVID as a run-of-the-mill disease—making it impossible to manage the illness whose devastation has defined the 2020s.

Each “not completely unreasonable” decision has trade-offs. [Piggybacking COVID vaccines onto flu shots](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/annual-seasonal-covid-vaccine-shots-federal-regulation/672854/), for instance, is convenient: Although COVID-vaccination rates still lag those of flu, they [might be even lower](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/respiratory-virus-season-covid-flu-rsv-vaccine-shots/675174/) if no one could predict when shots might show up. But such convenience may come at the cost of protecting Americans against COVID’s year-round threat. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, told me that a once-a-year vaccine policy is “dead wrong … There is no damn evidence this is a seasonal virus yet.” Safeguards against infection and milder illness start to fade within months, leaving people who dose up in autumn potentially more susceptible to exposures by spring. That said, experts are still torn on the benefits of administering the same vaccine more than once a year—especially to a public that’s largely unwilling to get it. Throughout the pandemic, immunocompromised people have been able to get extra shots. And today, an advisory committee to the CDC [voted](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2024-02-28-29/06-COVID-Wallace-508.pdf) to [recommend](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/98b18572-b151-412b-bc4c-352badef74a5) that older adults once again get an additional dose of the most recently updated COVID vaccine in the coming months. Neither is a pattern that flu vaccines follow.

Dropping the current COVID-isolation guideline—which has, since the end of 2021, recommended that people cloister for five days—may likewise be dangerous. Many Americans have long abandoned this isolation timeline, but given how new COVID is to both humanity and science, symptoms alone don’t yet seem enough to determine when mingling is safe, Popescu said. (The dangers are even tougher to gauge for infected people who never develop fevers or other symptoms at all.) Researchers don’t currently have a clear picture of how long people can transmit the virus once they get sick, Sifri told me. For most respiratory illnesses, fevers show up relatively early in infection, which is generally when people pose the most transmission risk, says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. But although SARS-CoV-2 [adheres](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00226-0/fulltext) to this same rough timeline, [infected people](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2202092) can [shed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9981266/) the virus [after their symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9045443/) begin to resolve and are “definitely shedding longer than what you would usually see for flu,” Gordon told me. (Asked about the specifics and precise timing of the update, a CDC spokesperson told me that there were “no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time,” and did not respond to questions about how flu precedents had influenced new recommendations.)

At the very least, Emily Landon, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Chicago, told me, recommendations for _all_ respiratory illnesses should tell freshly de-isolated people to mask for several days when they’re around others indoors; she would support some change to isolation recommendations with this caveat. But if the CDC aligns the policy fully with its flu policy, it might not mention masking at all.

Several experts told me symptom-based isolation might also remove remaining incentives to test for the coronavirus: There’s little point if the guidelines for all respiratory illnesses are essentially the same. To be fair, Americans have already been testing less frequently—in some cases, to _avoid_ COVID-specific requirements to stay away from work or school. And Osterholm and Gordon told me that, at this point in the pandemic, they agree that keeping people at home for five days isn’t sustainable—especially without paid sick leave, and particularly not for health-care workers, who are in short supply during the height of respiratory-virus season.

But the less people test, the less they’ll be diagnosed—and the less they’ll benefit from antivirals such as Paxlovid, which work best when administered early. Sifri worries that this pattern could yield another parallel to flu, for which many providers [hesitate](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/cdc-bad-flu-season-doctors-avoid-prescribing-tamiflu) to [prescribe](https://news.vumc.org/2023/11/13/study-finds-antiviral-treatment-is-largely-underused-in-children-with-influenza/) Tamiflu, [debating](https://www.center4research.org/tamiflu-not-tamiflu/) its effectiveness. Paxlovid use is already [shaky](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/why-more-people-should-be-prescribed-paxlovid-for-covid); both antivirals may end up chronically underutilized.

Flu-ification also threatens to further stigmatize long COVID. Other respiratory infections, including flu, have been [documented](https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/long-flu-has-emerged-as-a-consequence-similar-to-long-covid-19/) triggering long-term illness, but potentially at lower rates, and to different degrees than SARS-CoV-2 currently does. Folding this new virus in with the rest could make long COVID seem all the more negligible. What’s more, fewer tests and fewer COVID diagnoses could make it much harder to connect any chronic symptoms to this coronavirus, keeping patients out of long-COVID clinics—or reinforcing a false portrait of the condition’s rarity.

The U.S. does continue to treat COVID differently from flu in a few ways. Certain COVID products remain [more](https://aspr.hhs.gov/newsroom/Pages/FreeTestsSchools-29Nov23.aspx) [available](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/02/07/readout-of-hhs-secretary-becerras-meeting-with-pharmacy-ceos-on-covid-19-therapeutics-commercialization.html); some [precautions](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/09/covid-infection-surge-universal-masking-return/675239/) in health-care settings remain stricter. But these differences, too, will likely continue to fade, even as COVID’s burden persists. Tests, vaccines, and treatments are slowly commercializing; as demand for them drops, supply may too. And several experts told me that they wouldn’t be surprised if hospitals, too, soon flu-ify their COVID policies even more, for instance by allowing recently infected employees to return to work [once they’re fever-free](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/healthcaresettings.htm).

Early in the pandemic, public-health experts hoped that COVID’s tragedies would prompt a rethinking of _all_ respiratory illnesses. The pandemic showed what mitigations could do: During the first year of the crisis, isolation, masking, distancing, and shutdowns brought flu transmission to a near halt, and may have [driven an entire lineage](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/02/flu-vaccine-pandemic-change-yamagata-trivalent/677350/) of the virus [to extinction](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/04/yamagata-flu-transmission-lineage-extinction/673662/)—something “that never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think would be possible,” Landon told me.

Most of those measures weren’t sustainable. But America’s leaders blew right past a middle ground. The U.S. could have built and maintained systems in which everyone had free access to treatments, tests, and vaccines for a longer list of pathogens; it might have invested in widespread ventilation improvements, or enacted universal sick leave. American homes might have been stocked with [tests for a multitude of infectious microbes](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-test-all-respiratory-viruses/622959/), and masks to wear when people started to cough. Vaccine requirements in health-care settings and schools might have expanded. Instead, “we seem to be in a more 2019-like place than a future where we’re preventing giving each other colds as much as we could,” Bhattacharyya told me.

That means a return to a world in which [tens of thousands](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) of Americans die each year of flu and RSV, as they did in the 2010s. With COVID here to stay, every winter for the foreseeable future will layer on yet another respiratory virus—and a particularly deadly, disabling, and transmissible one at that. The [math](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/11/flu-season-winter-sickness-covid/676173/) is simple: “The risk has overall increased for everyone,” Landon said. That straightforward addition could have inspired us to expand our capacity for preserving health and life. Instead, our tolerance for suffering seems to be the only thing that’s grown.
