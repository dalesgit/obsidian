## Journal Entries
-  20 miles south of Brunswick last night we began losing air in left rear tire. I didn't know what the right decision was re. driving on. [[marypat]] was good to call the dealer. When he heard the description he assured me to head on into town to the hotel.
- This morning the tire was utterly flat, but again MP found a youtube to guide using the sealant / pump that comes in the car. It worked smoothly and now I wait at the dealer.

## Gratitude
- It could have been so much worse. We'll be leaving with 4 new tires.
