- One of 2 people who hate me.
- Resentment that I was preferred over her, that mom preferred boys over her
- Who would do what she did at a mother's funeral?
- She never worked, had to make a living
- Triangulated me with Bridget and Owen, continued with other events, e.g. the trip to Katrina wedding?
