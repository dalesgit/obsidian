## Journal Entries
-  We've spent time at the house. Like a dog peeing on its territory, we've both taken a shower. Brewed a basic cup of coffee. Eaten a basic sort of breakfast and lunch. 
- The last 24 hours have been emotionally troubling for me and for us, since Roe v. Wade ([Abortion](Abortion.md)) became official. I don't really know why it's so difficult for me. [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) wanted it "not to get between us." I felt like it wasn't that it got between us but that she was not in a position to comfort me. *Maybe that was selfish of me*.
- Yesterday was spent concluding our interviewing to get the water conditioning in place. MP was surprised that I let go of the need for Reverse Osmosis. My mentioning of Owen she had taken to mean that he was an authority for me in wanting it. Typical of missed communication, I was just trying to forge a conversation, while she was trying to figure me out, second guess, or please me. [wife](wife.md)
- MP wants to go to church -- I not so much. [spiritual](spiritual.md).
- I haven't [exercise](exercise.md)d in many days.
- I have tried to read about history of [[florida]] the last few days. [learn](learn.md)
- We've decided to go to St. Alfred's tomorrow for church.

## Gratitude
- I am truly grateful for this place to live. It will become home. But it's old and run down. Lots of things will bug me.
- Late night we watched a special on some science network reporting on the Space Shuttle. It was a **learning** thing.
