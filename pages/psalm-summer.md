### Psalm 130

*De profundis*

1. Out of the depths have I called to you, O Lord; 
Lord, hear my **voice**; * 
let your ears consider well the voice of my suppli**cation**.

2 If you, Lord, were to note what is done a**miss**, *
O Lord, who could **stand**?

3 For there is forgiveness with **you**; *  
therefore you shall be **feared**.

4 I wait for the Lord; my soul **waits for him**; *  
in his word is my **hope**.

5 My soul waits for the Lord,

6 O Israel, wait for the **Lord**, *  
for with the Lord there is **mercy**;

7 With him there is plenteous re**demption**, *  
and he shall redeem Israel from all their **sins**.
