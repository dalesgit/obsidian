## Journal Entries
-  We watched the opening of the Jan 6 hearings. Ominous music playing in the background as images and echoes of Watergate play in the background. It is obviously very staged, very "produced". Yet I find myself deeply moved by Liz Cheney's indictment of Donald Trump. Christ Wallace referred to his "fellow republicans", but his mouthpiece was CNN. 
- MP & I worked pretty well today, beginning with sharing in the phone call with the movers. They are frustrating and leave us anxious that there will be surprises along the way. The salesman forgot to ask me to estimate the "boxes". All in all we added ca. $3,000 to the bill. MP not happy.
- She had lunch with Jo. I had a conversation with Ed Pickup. It will suffice for saying goodbye to St. Paul's.

## Gratitude
- I'm grateful for the hint that this will be over soon.
