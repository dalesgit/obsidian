# Lost is a place, too

SpiritualDirection

The below is from Linda Serepca (Charlotte Spiritual Direction). I feel so grateful to her for finding the trajectory of spiritual narrative in my fractured hesitant life. The context is that I feel "lost to myself" as I said the last session. Some months ago I reported that I was struggling to know **my place in the universe**.

In her book, *Survivor*, Christina Crawford writes: “Lost is a place, too.”

That’s more than a clever sound-byte. It’s a deep truth that’s often lost in a world within which success, achievement, and good appearance define meaning and value.

What can that phrase teach us? That sometimes it’s good to be without success, without health, without achievements to bolster us, without good appearance, and even without meaning. Being down-and- out, alone, lost, struggling for meaning, and looking bad, is also a valid place to be.

One of the greatest spiritual writers of all time, John of the Cross, would agree with that. If he was your spiritual director and you explained to him that you were going through a dark, painful patch in life and asked him: “What’s wrong with me?” He would likely answer: [RonaldRolheiser](https://ronrolheiser.com/lost-is-a-place-too-2/)

At the Fall 2019 TEDxMileHigh event, I heard five words that I’ll never forget.

As Paula Stone-Williams talked about gender equity and living authentically, she said, “lost is a place, too.” The professional in me furiously scribbled down these words as they simultaneously slapped me in the face. But the 23-year-old struggling college graduate living with her parents in me wanted to walk up on stage and hug Paula for speaking directly to my soul. <https://www.tedxmilehigh.com/cut-yourself-slack-lost/>
