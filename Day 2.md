## Love Story
This was so amazing. Filmed in southwest Colorado. Star focus was named Faye. Actress name Dale. She was so **not** photo shopped. Deep wrinkles. She was a former bush pilot in Yellowstone. Could change an engine. There was a cartoon like appearance to some of the set pieces: the family looking to dig up their father, the postal delivery guy. 

She finally said to one of the lesbian couple, "You should get married. However long you get is long enough."

Meaning treasure the time you're given to love another.
