From the earliest era of my adult life, **words** have been the most intriguing thing about my life. 

- SÃ¶ren Kierkegaard
- poetry in all its guises
- theology as metaphor, *Analogical Imagination*
- post-em messages (inspired by David's "T", and given to MP in the early days of our life in Honoluu.)
