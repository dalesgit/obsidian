J.R.R. Tolkien famously asserted that [there is no such thing as writing “for children”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/12/05/j-r-r-tolkien-on-fairy-stories/). Decades later, **Maurice Sendak** (June 10, 1928–May 8, 2012) would come to [echo this belief](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/05/09/grim-colberty-tales-maurice-sendak/) — and yet he remains one of the best-loved and most influential children’s book authors and illustrators of all time, a patron saint of storytelling for young minds.
