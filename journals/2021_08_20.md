	- Prayed by Bp. Anne and posted this day by Steve Charleston
	  
	  Images of the sea and storms keep coming unbidden to my mind. \
	  I think of all of us out on the great waters of our recent history, being tossed about by the storms that swirl around us. \
	  However brave a crew we may be, there are ships among us who are lost and good people swept away. \
	  This image stays with me. It troubles me. \
	  Perhaps you understand where it comes from and perhaps it troubles you too. \
	  If so, then please join me in a shared vision today.\
	   I am praying for the waters to be calmed. \
	  For the storm to be stilled. \
	  For those in peril to be rescued. \
	  Throughout this day I am going to bring that vision to my mind, praying that the One who is able will bring peace to troubled waters. \
	  May every heart be joined in this simple but ever so powerful supplication and may all of our ancestors join us in the asking.
