# Cinco de Mayo
- she "needed a drink" because she'd had a challenging day -- left her with a melt-down
- matter-of-fact about Bridget being the omni-present force
- MPS thinks Nick seems like he's from another planet. I think he has a good heart but is kind of simple
- they are going to church. He may end up being baptized.
- I continue to be surprised at how little she's interested in finding out about my life. And then I tell myself that I shouldn't be surprised at all -- that children are that way. Case in point is Amy and Mary Pat.
- It seems that Lydia genuinely wants to connect with me.
- She made reference to: baptisms at St. Andrew's. Number of times she'd flown to Hawai'i (24?), she observed I didn't keep her up to date with our moves to say nothing of what's going on in our life.
- Nick figured that I was relieved to be on the 4th day of my actual retirement (from responsibilities)

You were a most beautiful bride. Your face shone with a radiant smile that outshone all others. I admire your courage and your persistence. I remember telling you that when you were just in double-digits.
