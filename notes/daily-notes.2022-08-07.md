## Journal Entries
-  Today's church was *Holy Trinity*. A *Cursillo* influenced community. Doing a lot of things right: homeless, washing laundry and talking to them, contemporary music, and *Common Lectionary*, alternative readings for gender-neutral language.
	- But also the negative of "*children's sermon*" at beginning of service, sound system.
- brunch at *East Lake Cafe*.
- My tasks have been about **categorizing things.** [[things-i-know]] 
- The break down of MP [MaryPat](MaryPat.md)] over things that she said to hurt me -- but to change was beyond her.

 
## Gratritude
- that we got the house in order, that I had a  kind of resolve to meet with LInda, 
- Finally MP was stabilized -- and then it all started again.
