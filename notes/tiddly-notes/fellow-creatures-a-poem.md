> A poem by Joanna Macy. "We hear you, fellow creatures. We know we are wrecking the world and we are afraid..."

---

This is an untitled (newly titled!) poem by Joanna Macy, a [deep ecologist](<https://www.thegreenfuse.org/johnstone.htm>). I found this poem many years ago on a website long lost to memory, but I’ve linked to Joanna’s website in her name below. I stumbled across the poem again today as I was looking through some of my old files. It still speaks to me, and in so much more than a quiet whisper. I’m sharing it with you now, and I hope you love it, too.

> We hear you, fellow creatures.

> We know we are wrecking the world and we are afraid.

>
> What we have unleashed has such momentum now,

> we don’t know how to turn it around.

>
>
> Don’t leave us alone, we need your help.
>
>
>
> You need us too for your own survival.

>
> Are there powers there you can share with us?

> Time is my friend.

> This is what I give you: patience for the long haul and perseverance.”

> “It is a dark time. As deep-diving trout I offer you my fearlessness of the dark.”

> “I, lion, give you my roar, the voice to speak out and be heard.”

>
> “I am caterpillar. The leaves I eat taste bitter now. But dimly I sense a great change coming. What I offer you, humans, is my willingness to dissolve and transform. I do that without knowing what the end-result will be, so I share with you my courage too.”
