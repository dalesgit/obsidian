	  Apprehend God in all things, for God is in all things.\
	  Every single creature is full of God and is a book about God.\
	  Every creature is a word of God.\
	  If I spent enough time with the tiniest creature—even a caterpillar—I would never have to prepare a sermon.\
	  So full of God is every creature.
	  
	  *Meister Eckhart*
