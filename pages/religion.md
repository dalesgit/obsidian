The most cogent argument that I have seen arise against Roe v. Wade in these past couple of months was the offensive religious assumptions that were opposed by a rabbi's lawsuit from, I think, Florida.

It feels like it won't go anywhere, but to me seems like a blatant establishment of religion. 

It is held alongside the approval of a coach's praying publicly with his athletes and many more to come I expect.
