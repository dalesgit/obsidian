Even as lessons on Black history draw complaints from Republican governors, who argue the instruction is ideological, several blue states are moving in the opposite direction — mandating classes in African American, Latino and Puerto Rican studies — and setting up a uniquely American division over how we teach our past.
​
Since 2019, partly in response to the murder of George Floyd, at least four reliably Democratic states — [Connecticut](https://www.270towin.com/states/Connecticut), [Delaware](https://www.270towin.com/states/Delaware), [Maine](https://www.270towin.com/states/Maine) and [Rhode Island](https://www.270towin.com/states/Rhode_Island) — have passed laws requiring instruction on Black history, according to a database maintained by the [research agency Education Commission of the States](https://www.ecs.org/state-education-policy-tracking/). Connecticut’s [law](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2019/ACT/pa/pdf/2019PA-00012-R00HB-07082-PA.pdf) says African American, Puerto Rican and Latino studies must be included in the social studies component of all public school curriculums. [Delaware’s](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fn-document-service/file-by-sha384/13554f5a3533b849ba7510b6de33caaec44f9c7e119211f7fd3091cf7ef0f07b9911ab43eddd6f8b895b5a7ac6609bf6) mandates that school districts offer instruction on Black history. [Maine’s](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fn-document-service/file-by-sha384/542e3456a7984d042b50b304614547ca116727c89acc1cb46b417e5aca6057ad90d6e8e251d9d113859a15558ab37d7f) says that African American studies and the history of genocide must be included in state testing standards. And [Rhode Island’s](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fn-document-service/file-by-sha384/50398c0bf6c763e44fa4bc5024e8c4414b221e276a7174988056cd4ead5cb10372560de8db66d800bb2a2e0c4c83fd23) orders schools to include a unit on African History and Heritage.
​
In the past three years, an additional seven states have passed laws establishing K-12 courses in ethnic studies or on Native American, Asian American or Filipino history, per the Education Commission’s database.
​
Meanwhile, Republican state governors and administrations spent the weeks leading up to Black History Month this year interrogating how, or if, teachers should discuss aspects of race, racism and American history in the classroom.
​
In Virginia, state education officials appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) proposed [shifting the focus of a state history curriculum away from Black and Native peoples](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/11/16/virginia-school-history-standards-youngkin/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10) in a revision process that is ongoing. In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders [issued a January executive order barring teachers from delivering certain messages about race](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/01/11/arkansas-critical-race-theory/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10). And in Florida **—** which has already passed restrictive laws similar to the Arkansas order **—** Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) flayed a proposed AP African American studies course, after which the [College Board altered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/01/ap-african-american-studies-curriculum-desantis/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10) that curriculum to exclude [lessons on Black Lives Matter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/02/college-board-ap-african-american-studies-criticism/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10). Eighteen state laws similarly circumscribing what teachers can say about race and the country’s history of race relations have taken effect over the last three years, [per a tally compiled by The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/10/18/education-laws-culture-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10).
