The Great Litany
================

*To be said or sung, kneeling, standing, or in procession; before the Eucharist or after the Collects of Morning or Evening Prayer; or separately; especially in Lent and on Rogation days.*

O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,
*Have mercy upon us.*

O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,
*Have mercy upon us.*

O God the Holy Spirit, Sanctifier of the faithful,
*Have mercy upon us.*

O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,
*Have mercy upon us.*

Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us, for ever.
*Spare us, good Lord.*

From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

*Page 149*

From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

From all inordinate and sinful affections; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

From lightening and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of thy Holy Ghost,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*

In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,
*Good Lord, deliver us.*
