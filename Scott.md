He feels like a brother to me.

After watching penultimate *This is us*, where Rebeccah dies, he confessed to emotions (no doubt flowing from his own mother's recent death). Like a brother to me.

He had called wonder if it would be ok if he looked to relocate to Florida near where I was moving.

Amy (claritywithamy.com) therapist with whom Scott clearly has a strong relationship. Started with effort to get help for Kelsey when Brian went into treatment. Eventually Brian/Kelsey have seen her together and separately. Martha/Fred have seen her together (maybe separately). Scott/Loa have seen her together/separately.

First time gave him "detachment prayer." (Detach from dysfunctional connections but not to let go of the love.)

## Timeline
- 4-7 years my Dad was at their house 5-7 nights per week. Early Scott knew something was not right -- came to detest my father. It all began after my parents separated / divorced.
- Eventually it stopped. My dad called it off? Mary Jean was ca. 1969-70?
- Scott's dad never knew? Never admitted to self? His last words to Scott's mother were to the effect, "Go ahead and drink yourself to death." "She was a fun drunk to everyone else, but to my dad she was mean and abusive."
- Mo's dad died ca. April 1985. My dad May 29, 1985. Scott's dad Sept. 1985. Scott's dad was pall bearer for my father. Brian was born ?? in 1985?
- He had told my dad that "because of her drinking" he shouldn't come around any more.
- Already at that time Scott had had 1 intervention / treatment.
## Lots of memories of long ago past of our childhood.
- "Chuck's" where there was cinnamon toothpicks.
- He played video games there.
- Scott remembers faculty at LHS having affair with student. He used it to blackmail the teacher to give him passing grades. His last semester he barely went to school and rather climbed every day.
- He remembered a time that he froze on the cliff. He chose to keep going. 
- He remembers me as being more talented and smarter than I ever feel -- but I guess something there.
- The mistakes are for learning what not to do in the future.
- Getting away from Brian's drinking is partly behind his desire to come to Florida. Also feeling healthier and stronger at sea level.
