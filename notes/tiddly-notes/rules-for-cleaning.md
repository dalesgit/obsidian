* If you open it — close it
* If you turn it on — turn it off
* If you unlock it — lock it
* If you break it — mend it
* If you borrow it — return it
* If you use it — take care of it
* If you make a mess — clean it up
* If you move it — put it back
* If it doesn’t concern you — leave the bloody thing alone!
