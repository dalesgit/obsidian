	- Sean,
	  I regard you as essentially a coward. You are unable to be honest. You  are essentially manipulative and intent on doing your own self-interested purposes. Ah, you would like to proclaim to the world that you are altruistic and looking out for others. Trying to serve others' interests. Your refusal to engage me these past few weeks was all about trying to cater to my needs. Give me a break. You haven't a clue as to my needs. You don't have the courage to be a true healer, a true breaker o f the bonds. You are a con from the get go.
