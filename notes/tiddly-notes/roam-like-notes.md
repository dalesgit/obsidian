[A real-world workflow with ](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ipd24k/anybody_willing_to_share_their_orgroam_workflow/) applied to taking a university course. Could pretty naturally connect with teaching a course.

[Good examination of how to critically use ](https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/a-review-mechanism-for-notes/153) org-roam â€“ but really any of these Roam-like Notes.

[Another nice workflow ](https://www.alexkehayias.com/essays/zettelkasten-setup/) which includes important use of git.

[A good overview of setup with links to resources ](https://ianjones.us/own-your-second-brain)
