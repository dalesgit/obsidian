# ValuesofSociety

This gets at figuring out what society values. I have said for years now that that is what my long hair is about, not Trump but the society that values him. I have said for decades that the shifting point in our society was when it became OK for a President to lie not when they did actually lie. That was when Nixon called his lies "misspoken" and the media didn't label it a lie and it became acceptable.

Insight into this and how to recognize it is related to the critical point I learned in seminary about marriage of clergy and the medieval condemnation of it as evidence that it was practiced then. Otherwise there would be no reason to outlaw it.

Similarly was Augustine's *Confessions* giving an illustration of the first person known to have read a book silently, to himself. Many are they who have dated the development of **Interiority** to Augustine. Catholic Church
