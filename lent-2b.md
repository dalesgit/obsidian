## notes
- renaming at covenant
	- gen 17:4 "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations
	- law vs faith. The promise to Abraham through faith not law. 
	- Earlier promise of heirs chapter 13 at oaks of mamre. 
- Mark 8:31-38  
	- 8:31 Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.  
	- 8:32 He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
- Great reversal. 
	- Paradox. 8:35 For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it.
	- Son of man must suffer
	- 
## draft ideas

- Suffering as universal Ala Buddhism
- being Chosen. Promise and covenant.
