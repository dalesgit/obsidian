Mike,

First, please accept our deep gratitude for your willingness to assist us in our lifetime adventure during this cruise. You have been a faithful friend in our relatively short time of knowing you. That is a rich treasure. I'm sure we haven't thought of everything, and we both trust your responsible decision-making. 

### Mail
1. It is our hope that we will be able to communicate with you on a regular basis. It's not yet clear what form that will take.
2. Our mail has been forwarded to your address. Much of it, of course, is trash at the get go.Here and there they will be important pieces.
3. There are 2 envelopes that we are asking you to mail later in the new year.
4. Many of our tax documents will be forwarded to our accountant.

### Plants
1. The "Monster" plant is in the entryway. I water it occasionally. There is moisture gauge and water container in the entryway.
2. All the other plants are on the lanai. 
- The anthurium is new. The directions indicate to put 5 ice cubes in it once per week.
- The bonsai is watered ever 3-4 days. 
- The others as needed.

### In case of emergency
1. There is an envelope marked "Emergency" in the drawer of the desk with the computer on it. In it is usb drive that contains a file that identifies most of the passwords associated with Dale's online presence.
2. There is a short list (not comprehensive) of subscriptions that are regularly paid for through auto-payment.
3. The ADT alarm on the wall in the dining room goes off occasionally. Monthly? The only way I know how to stop it is by pushing buttons. "#" of "off" seem to work.
