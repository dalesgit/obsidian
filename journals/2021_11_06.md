	  Why I asked this, well,\
	  this will make sense to you\
	  or it won’t, but every closed\
	  door I was aware of\
	  had became a point of suffering.\
	  And with every open door,\
	  I could feel congruence,\
	  the world rushing in to create\
	  more space in me.\
	  And god said to me, though\
	  we could not say that it was a voice,\
	  god said, Open even the door with people jeering\
	  on the other side, their faces twisted\
	  in hate? Even the door to an entire\
	  forest of sorrow? And because\
	  this conversation was not really\
	  happening, we could not say that\
	  I said yes to the questions, but\
	  we could say, perhaps, that\
	  the yes began to root in me\
	  and it was not so much a matter\
	  of someone opening the doors\
	  but that the doors more or less\
	  dissolved. And what I had thought\
	  could separate me from anything else\
	  was shown to be nothing at all.\
	  I would like to tell you that I felt grace\
	  in the opening, but the truth\
	  is I felt such terrible ache.\
	  And god did not come put a hand\
	  on my cheek and tell me\
	  everything would be okay.\
	  In fact, if anything, the voice\
	  I did not hear told me\
	  there are no promises.\
	  But I felt it, the invitation\
	  to keep opening doors,\
	  to not close my eyes,\
	  to not turn away.\
	  And though I do not pray,\
	  I said thank you, thank you
