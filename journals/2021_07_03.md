	  I learned from St. Mary's web page that Greg Holmes died in the Spring. Funeral 3/31. Video showed St. Mary's tentatively coming back together in the sanctuary. Small numbers. But there was : Bill, Jackie, Ruth, back Isamu's head, Bridget, Richert. Their priest seemed so loud and out of place. I'm glad if they're happy with it. It seemed mostly just sad. Pablo spoke.
	  
	  Greg was close to me in age. I think maybe he had diabetes or something. But still it struck close.
	  
	  At couple counseling I confessed to Bridget that children mostly made me feel sad, grief, loss. She said she understood, but I responded you don't.
	  
	  > it occurred to me even as I spoke that she does know something of it with so many years of Sean being lost to addiction. But she's now in the throes of his return â€“ the Prodigal Son.
