*Octavia Butler on the Meaning of God*

> Another century hence, another prophet of the ages saw, and named, the underlying truth beneath these truths: that if this *you*, this *me*, is in fact [an ever-changing chance-constellation](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/12/g-k-chesterton-dandelion/) of cells, ideas, beliefs, impressions, mental states, emotional weather systems, constantly making and remaking itself into what we experience as selfhood, then God is the other name of chance and change, of that flickering constellation. God is the name we — [“atoms with consciousness,”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/04/22/richard-feynman-yo-yo-ma/) who know that one day we shall become [“one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/25/dirge-without-music-emmy-noether/) but wish it to be otherwise with every atomic fiber of our being — is the name we give to [our touching longing for permanence in a universe of change](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/05/22/alan-lightman-accidental-universe-impermanence/).

> On change, the measure of intelligence, the courage to take responsibility for our own lives.
Defining intelligence as “ongoing, individual adaptability” and reminding us that “civilization is to groups what intelligence is to individuals,” she considers our orientation to “God” — to change — as a vital adaptation that shapes the outcome of any individual human life. In a mighty antidote to our present culture of abdicating personal responsibility for our own lives (which, as Joan Didion knew, is [another term for character](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/05/21/joan-didion-on-self-respect/)) in favor of competitive victimhood, Butler writes:

> A victim of God may,  
> Through learning adaption,  
> Become a partner of God,  
> A victim of God may,  
> Through forethought and planning,  
> Become a shaper of God.  
> Through shortsightedness and fear,  
> Remain God’s victim,  
> God’s plaything,  
> God’s prey.
