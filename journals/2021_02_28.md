	  It's Sunday. MP is sleeping â€“ presumeably sleeping off the 2^nd^ Covid shot. Possibly depression? Her siblings went to the grave site yesterday and she was sad to not be there. **I have such a powerful sense of loving her unconditionally in her weakness.** I suppose it is when she is being "strong" by pushing back against me that I have trouble.
	  
	  E.G. I sometimes feel like everything I say, no matter what, she will respond with, "No ..." She will quickly look something up to demonstrate that I am wrong. Responding takes the form of a rebuttal.
	  
	  But when she is just being with me she is such a darling.
