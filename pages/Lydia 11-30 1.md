I had hoped to speak to you. Of course we haven’t had such a great track record with that. I will send you a check for $300 in the morning. That will cover the part of your money needs that you identified. I asked Miriam what she thought would be most helpful to you at this time. She responded, “That’s a good question. I’m not sure. I would imagine just checking in on her and asking that very question. I think so much is up in the air, it might be hard for her to know what would help. But just saying you’re there if she needs anything seems like it would be comforting." I am here and wanting with all my heart to help.

One thing seems clear to me and that is that you are going through some really difficult times right now. You need all the help you can get in making "good decisions" -- as I used to say. I would gladly help pay for counseling or therapy. That sort of thing has been very important to me over the years to try to "make good decisions." I love you very much, more than words can possibly say.
