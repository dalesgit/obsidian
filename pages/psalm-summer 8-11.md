### Psalm 104:1-9, 25, 37b

*Benedic, anima mea*

1 Bless the Lord, O my **soul**; *  
O Lord my God, how excellent is your greatness!  
you are clothed with majesty and **splendor**.

2 You wrap yourself with light as with a **cloak** *  
and spread out the heavens like a **curtain**.

3 You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters a**bove**; *  
you make the clouds your chariot;  
you ride on the wings of the **wind**.

4 You make the winds your **messengers** *  
and flames of fire your **servants**.

5 You have set the earth upon its foun**dations**, *  
so that it never shall move at **any time**.

6 You covered it with the Deep as with a **mantle**; *  
the waters stood higher than the **mountains**.

7 At your rebuke they **fled**; *  
at the voice of your thunder they hastened a**way**.

8 They went up into the hills and down to the valleys be**neath**, *  
to the places you had ap**pointed for them**.

9 You set the limits that they should not **pass**; *  
they shall not again cover the **earth**.

25 O Lord, how manifold are your **works**! *  
in wisdom you have made them all;  
the earth is full of your creatures.

37b Halle**lujah**!
