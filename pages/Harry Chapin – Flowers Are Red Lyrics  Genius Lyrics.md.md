> This is a classic tale from Harry about how children learn from their teachers and how conformity can be taught in schools. The moral of the story is that we should let children express themselves, not try to make them conform to our own ideals of what things should be or look like.

## Flowers Are Red Lyrics

\[Verse 1\]  
The little boy went first day of school  
He got some crayons and he started to draw  
He put colors all over the paper  
For colors was what he saw  
And the teacher said, "What you doing, young man?"  
"I'm painting flowers" he said  
She said, "It's not the time for art, young man  
And anyway, flowers are green and red  
There's a time for everything, young man  
And a way it should be done  
You've got to show concern for everyone else  
For you're not the only one"

\[Chorus\]  
And she said  
"Flowers are red, young man  
And green leaves are green  
There's no need to see flowers any other way  
Than they way they always have been seen"  
But the little boy said  
"There are so many colors in the rainbow  
So many colors in the morning sun  
So many colors in a flower  
And I see every one"

\[Verse 2\]  
The teacher said, "You're sassy  
There's ways that things should be  
And you'll paint flowers the way they are  
So repeat after me"

\[Chorus\]  
And she said  
"Flowers are red, young man  
And green leaves are green  
There's no need to see flowers any other way  
Than they way they always have been seen"  
But the little boy said  
"There are so many colors in the rainbow  
So many colors in the morning sun  
So many colors in a flower  
And I see every one"

\[Verse 3\]  
The teacher put him in a corner  
She said "It's for your own good  
And you won't come out 'til you get it right  
And are responding like you should"  
Well, finally he got lonely  
Frightened thoughts filled his head  
And he went up to the teacher  
And this is what he said

\[Chorus\]  
And he said  
"Flowers are red  
And green leaves are green  
There's no need to see flowers any other way  
Than the way they always have been seen"

\[Verse 4\]  
Time went by like it always does  
And they moved to another town  
And the little boy went to another school  
And this is what he found  
The teacher there was smiling  
She said, "Painting should be fun  
And there are so many colors in a flower  
So let's use every one"  
[But that little boy painted flowers  
In neat rows of green and red  
And when the teacher asked him why  
This is what he said](https://genius.com/17868489/Harry-chapin-flowers-are-red/But-that-little-boy-painted-flowers-in-neat-rows-of-green-and-red-and-when-the-teacher-asked-him-why-this-is-what-he-said)

\[Chorus\]  
And he said  
"Flowers are red  
And green leaves are green  
There's no need to see flowers any other way  
Than the way they always have been seen"

How to Format Lyrics:

-   Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus
-   Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines
-   Use section headers above different song parts like \[Verse\], \[Chorus\], etc.
-   Use italics (<i>lyric</i>) and bold (<b>lyric</b>) to distinguish between different vocalists in the same song part
-   If you don’t understand a lyric, use \[?\]
