- I don't know what happened last night.
  collapsed:: true
	- I went to bed without brushing my teeth and I don't remember the last time that happened.
	- We had just finished watching the movie "Still Alice" [[still-alice]]. [[Marypat]] had wanted to watch it in preparation for our last conversation at church.
	- I wasn't upset with her, but she had had a long nap and I only a brief and interrupted one.
	- I think I was sad. I wake up feeling vaguely afraid. I think the movie was behind that.
- Mary Pat went to a workshop with several hundred women from around the diocese yesterday. She met Dabney. He asked her a curious question, "Does Dale know you're here?"
  collapsed:: true
	- I wondered what that meant. Was it a joke? Was he presuming something about me? Churchmanship? Controlling?
- Feelings? What's going on inside?
  collapsed:: true
	- Is it a contrast to MP's healthy efforts: dieting, cutting back on drinking, socializing, ...? She's getting better in so many ways.
	- Does it have to do with sorrow at my distance from my family? Fear of all this happening to [[Bill]] & [[Karla]]?
	- My loss of the regular habit of writing?
	- [[Carolyn]] was very present on my mind, waking from a dream. There was a house with people from throughout my life in it. I wasn't sure of my place in it. It was my home but in some way wasn't.
