### *metanoete*: 

1. how important is the translation?

- Jesus quite clearly believed in change. In fact, the first public word out of his mouth was the Greek imperative verb *metanoeite*, which literally translates as “change your mind” or “go beyond your mind” (Matthew 3:2, 4:17, and Mark 1:15).

### Conversion / Changing one's mind

- p. 92 “in secret, where your Father who sees all that is done in secret can reward you” (Matthew 6:4, 6, 18). Jesus invariably emphasized **inner motivation** and intention in his moral teaching.
- This is similar or compatible with **Centering Prayer**
