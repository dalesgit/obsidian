Yesterday was the wedding day. [Lydias-wedding](Lydias-wedding.md). 

The feeble effort of Miriam to "not take sides" reminded me this morning of my oft-repeated, "There are 2 kinds of people in the world, those who divide the world into 2 kinds of people and those who don't." [eyes-to-see](eyes-to-see.md)

I absolutely hate the way the dynamics of yesterday turn me into an invisible non-entity. It repeats the dynamic of life with Bridget (and Shirley) that I'm the problem, that I'm crazy.

I repeat to myself sometimes hourly, "What could I have done differently?" Not as to the marriage and all that water under the bridge, but just during the event yesterday. The brief conversation with Fr. Brian Grantz was so human and so mutually respectful. In contrast the icy response of the bulk of the population there was frigid, bitter, and deathly.
