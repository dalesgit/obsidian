## Journal Entries
-  MP couldn't sleep in the night because of anxiety and worry over the Hilton transaction. We talked. I felt only the need not to carry with us worry or regret -- to move on from decision. I sought to establish options:
1. cancel the purchase with Hilton. Florida provides 10 day opt out plan. [[timeshare]]
2. She anticipates using the Amex card as facilitating the purchase. And she is moving her annuity withdrawal to increase our income. She feels OK about it by morning. 
3. Working on solutions in the morning.
