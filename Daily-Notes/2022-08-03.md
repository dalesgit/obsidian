## Journal Entries
-  Mp objected to my canceling my spiritual direction appointment.  We talked, finally. For MP [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) there's a lot of fear related to her physical frailty and deterioration. I know there's control issues. I don't know what to about the control needs. But I emphasized in our talk the need to listen. I reiterated my commitment and love to her. 
- We had a modicum of getting along throughout the day. She wanted to talk about issues: 
	- the placement of items in the kitchen
	- the placement of items in the office
	- cupboards in the kitchen, linen closets in the bathroom
- She wants to talk about the things she's reading -- I think not for conversation but to tell me about her ideas. It's an opportunity for me to share of my own thinking.
- I made good headway in having a presentable space in our non-bedroom space.

## Gratitude
- that MP talked. I had missed her texting from the night before. I pointed out to her the obsession she has with her phone (or a device) -- detracting from our ability to have  aconversation.
