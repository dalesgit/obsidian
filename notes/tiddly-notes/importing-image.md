You actually didn't paste the location at 4:54 but rather the entire image encoded in base64, just like the one embedded in the tiddlywiki code!

If one plans to use a lot of pictures and such, it might be better to make a directory in the folder with the tiddly file named images, and then when you want a picture you can put

```
[img [./images/PICTURE.PNG]].
```

This would let you edit pictures easier, and would keep the main file small.
