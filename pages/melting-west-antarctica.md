​
The ice shelves around Antarctica are an essential barrier, holding huge volumes of ice on the continent.
​
Research ships that arrived in West Antarctica during mid-December when conditions are most favorable have reported an unprecedented marine heatwave threatening the stability of the giant ice platforms.
​
Marine heatwaves worldwide have substantially increased over the past decades, but not so much in Antarctica. The deep ocean heat corrodes the ice shelf from underneath the ice creating tunnels and fissures that weaken the ability to provide resistance to land ice.
​
At the two most essential chunks of ice in the world, Pine Island and Thwaites, the pinning points that fasten the ice to the bedrock are disintegrating, sparking fears of runaway melt and rising sea levels.
