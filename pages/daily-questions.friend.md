May 31: I pursued establishing the dinner engagement with Al and Lynn Askew. MP didn't believe me when I said that she should call Lynn, since she values the relationship so much. I ended up calling.

I reviewed some messages I had shared with [[jim-becker]]. They reminded me of things I'd shared with [Scott](Scott.md) over the years. I have often called him my **best** friend. There is a bond with Jim -- he is an ex-marine, like our friend Patrick from Nashotah House days.

I wrote thank you notes to [Jim Becker](Jim%20Becker.md)'s family. It was the little bit of writing that I did and it felt like a big accomplishment, a sense of satisfaction (as I think I felt with getting the internet and video-cam working ([create](create.md))

No word yet today from Scott. Perhaps it will be an opportunity to talk to Bill and Karla. He seems to relish the connections he makes with me. I feel like I just listen. But perhaps I listen non-judgmentally and tend to find a a spiritual interpretation. Perhaps I'm just encouraging an escapist impulse in him. He seems so manic -- even frantic -- in some of his dialogues. He has trouble sticking to a thread, but gets jerked hither and yon. As [MaryPat](MaryPat.md) observes he frequently goads along political fissures. I tend not to go there, though she does.
