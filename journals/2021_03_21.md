	- Worked on today:
	  
	  1. Corrected Doom emacs to enable **org-ref** so that citations work
	  1. Watched National Cathedral
	  1. Looked at each of my blogs. Surprised by some of what was written there surprised me. Got a working index for **Checkvist**. Need to get tags?
	  1. Sorted Palm Sunday past sermons to get some direction and inspiration
	  1. Worked on music for Easter. Downloaded the videos and have a working list.
	  1. 3 mile walk
	  1. made a riotously dense salad
