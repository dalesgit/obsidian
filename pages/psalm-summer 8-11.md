## Psalm 34:1-8, (19-22)
*Benedicam Dominum*

1 I will bless the Lord at **all times**; *
his praise shall ever be in my **mouth**.
*
2 I will glory in the **Lord**; *
let the humble hear and re**joice**.

3 Proclaim with me the greatness of the **Lord**; *
let us exalt his Name to**gether**.

4 I sought the Lord, and he **answered me** *
and delivered me out of all my **terror**.

5 Look upon him and be **radiant**, *
and let not your faces be a**shamed**.
