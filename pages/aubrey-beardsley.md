The art of dying is hard to master, especially if you bequeath an artistic legacy. Live too long, and your reputation may be marred by retrograde politics or senescent late work. Pass too soon, and your best years may be presumed to lie ahead. Aubrey Beardsley nearly fell prey to the second fate. The artist and aspiring writer was just twenty-five when tuberculosis ended his life on March 16, 1898. In a sense, his entire œuvre could be classed as juvenalia, fit only for dismissal or could-have-been counterfactual. But his short and dazzling [career](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-faith-behind-aubrey-beardsleys-sexually-charged-art) in fact suggests one way to master the art of dying: work fast, expire early, and define a decade’s aesthetics.
​
Beardsley’s birth and death aligned with a distinct period in British and art history. This twilight of the Victorian era witnessed one revolution in gender and sexual politics and another in visual aesthetics. Beardsley’s pen-and-ink drawings synthesized the two. His prospectus illustration for *The Yellow Book*, one of the two magazines he co-founded and edited, captures his art work’s effect, as well as its marketability. In this image, a stylish lady has seized an ink-soaked evening to wander unchaperoned; she browses for books, not boys, and pointedly disregards the vendor before her. It is night prowling done in black blocks and driving lines, Art Nouveau for the independent New Woman.
​
In just six working years, Beardsley produced more than a thousand art works and was hailed as “the very essence of the decadent *fin de siècle*” for transgressing both social and aesthetic norms. (The art critic Roger Fry preferred the label “Fra Angelico of Satanism.”) Beardsley was no snob when it came to the commissions he accepted—he lent his talents to Christmas cards and poster advertisements alongside book covers and lavish illustrated editions. Advances in print technology, especially photo-engraving, allowed these images to circulate at a high speed and low price. From galleries to shop windows, Beardsley’s distinctive style briefly flooded London.
​
“Aubrey Beardsley, 150 Years Young” (Grolier), by Margaret Stetz, returns us to the Beardsley moment. The comprehensive and visually rich exhibition catalogue extends an [exquisite show](https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/aubrey-beardsley-150-years-young) at New York’s Grolier Club last fall that Stetz and her partner Mark Samuels Lasner co-curated for the sesquicentennial of Beardsley’s birth. Better still: the book is compact and priced at just twenty-five dollars. In contrast, Linda Gertner Zatlin’s “[Catalogue Raisonné](https://www.amazon.com/Aubrey-Beardsley-Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-British/dp/0300111274)” of Beardsley’s work comprises two heavy volumes and costs nearly two hundred dollars more. For those uninclined to allocate table space or funds, “150 Years Young” is a welcome alternative.
​
Book prices mattered a great deal to Beardsley. He was an insatiable reader with a collecting penchant but, unlike many Victorian aesthetes, was not born into wealth. Beardsley’s mother hailed from a debt-ridden branch of the illustrious Pitt family; his father lost his modest inheritance in a lawsuit settlement soon after entering the marriage. Beardsley grew up knowing that he would have to earn his own living, but he was diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was seven, making many vocations impossible. For the rest of his life, he was periodically kept in bed by flareups of the disease. In these interludes, he read and drew extensively. Charles Dickens’s books inspired an early childhood commission: a set of dinner place cards that helped net the ten-year-old thirty pounds from a family friend, in 1882.
