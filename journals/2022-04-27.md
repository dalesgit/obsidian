Yesterday we had a glorious dinner in Dunedin. Overlooking the inland waterway. We stayed long enough to see the sunset. MP had leg of lamb. I had a grouper with capers. 

I ended the day feeling down. Not depressed, but as I said to MP "not happy." She took that to mean that I was sad, but I didn't mean it that way. I didn't know how to explain.

The panic I felt was that in the middle of the night I woke up to pee and realized that I hadn't taken evening pills. The Mexican take-out dinner and subsequent conversation had just knocked that out of my mind.
