Trying to figure out macros.

* cf. <https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Macro%2520Definitions%2520in%2520WikiText.html>

* <https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Table-of-Contents%2520Macros.html>
* <https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Order%2520of%2520Tagged%2520Tiddlers.html>
* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32234128/how-to-setup-table-of-content-in-tiddlywiki> This is a "how-to" but it doesn't seem to work for me. Mark the "root" tag on a tiddler. Then in nested tiddlers tag them with the secondary tag.

This is a nested piece using the dropdown menu to "create a new journal."
