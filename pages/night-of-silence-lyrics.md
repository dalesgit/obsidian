Night of Silence - Silent Night

Cold are the people, winter of life,  
We tremble in shadows this cold endless night,  
Frozen in the snow lie roses sleeping,  
Flowers that will echo the sunrise,  
Fire of hope is our only warmth,  
Weary, it's flame will be dying soon.

Voice in the distance, call in the night,  
On wind you enfold us You speak of the light,  
Gentle on the ear you whisper softly,  
Rumours of a dawn so embracing,  
Breathless love awaits darkened souls,  
Soon will we know of the morning.

Spirit among us, shine like the star,  
Your light that guides shepherds and kings from afar,

Shimmer in the sky so empty, lonely,  
Rising in the warmth of your Son's love,  
Star unknowing of night and day,  
Spirit we wait for your loving Son.

Silent night, holy night,  
All is calm, all is bright,  
Round yon Virgin Mother and child,  
Holy infant so tender and mild,  
Sleep in heavenly peace,  
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Weary it's flame will be dying soon
