### Psalm 24

*Domini est terra*

1 The earth is the Lord's and all that is **in it**,   
the world and all who dwell there**in**.

2 For it is he who founded it upon the **seas** *  
and made it firm upon the rivers of the **deep**.

3 "Who can ascend the hill of the **Lord**? *  
and who can stand in his **holy place**?"

4 "Those who have clean hands and a **pure heart**, *  
who have not pledged themselves to falsehood,  
nor sworn by what is a **fraud**.

5 They shall receive a blessing from the **Lord** *  
and a just reward from the God of their sal**vation**."

6 Such is the generation of those who **seek him**, *  
of those who seek your face, O God of **Jacob**.
