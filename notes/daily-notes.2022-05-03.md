Today we head for the north and eventually [Lydias-wedding](Lydias-wedding) . Both of us would rather avoid it. 

I'm feeling numb about leaving St. Paul's.

We've arrived in Columbus at Joe & Tami's. It feels like family.

Joe asks about how it feels to not have to prepare a weekly sermon. Mostly I'm not sure. Some relief, for sure. But apprehension about losing something within.

During the drive (8.5 hours) we drove through several rain downpours. Somewhat associated with those "washings" I was startled to look out the windows and see a range of colors that modestly "took my breath away." It was a little like seeing things for the first time. [eyes-to-see](eyes-to-see).

Joe & Tami provided a lovely Mexican takeout dinner. Tami went to bed early, but an easy conversation followed.
