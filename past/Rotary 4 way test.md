The Rotary "4-Way Test" has become an important fixture in Rotary- guiding Rotarians in their personal lives as well as in their professional lives.

  
The Four-Way Test From the earliest days of the organization, Rotarians were concerned with promoting high ethical standards in their professional lives. One of the world's most widely printed and quoted statements of business ethics is The Four-Way Test, which was created in 1932 by Rotarian Herbert J. Taylor (who later served as RI president) when he was asked to take charge of a company that was facing bankruptcy. This 24-word test for employees to follow in their business and professional lives became the guide for sales, production, advertising, and all relations with dealers and customers, and the survival of the company is credited to this simple philosophy. Adopted by Rotary in 1943, The Four-Way Test has been translated into more than a hundred languages and published in thousands of ways.

It asks the following four questions: "Of the things we think, say or do:

-   Is it the TRUTH?
-   Is it FAIR to all concerned?
-   Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
-   Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?"

Roxie Wetterau, Club President in 2014-5, added an important fifth test:

           Is it FUN?

Four Avenues of Service Based on the Object of Rotary, the Four Avenues of Service are Rotary's philosophical cornerstone and the foundation on which club activity is based:

-   Club Service focuses on strengthening fellowship and ensuring the effective functioning of the club.
-   Vocational Service encourages Rotarians to serve others through their vocations and to practice high ethical   standards.
-   Community Service covers the projects and activities the club undertakes to improve life in its community.
-   International Service encompasses actions taken to expand Rotary's humanitarian reach around the globe and to promote world understanding and peace.
