	- dream on waking:
	  
	  MP and I were at some kind of event. Felt like southern Jefferson Co. We needed to leave. There was back and forth I think with expectations, but finally I was frustrated at waiting for her to finish whatever. I began to walk. There was hope that we would connect â€“ at the car? down the road? There were lots of people. Lots of construction. I was walking north. We didn't connect. Then my phone went on the blink. Rebooting. Not connected to the grid. I was unable to reach her. I kept walking. I was in a big building. People like at a convention. I ran into Peter Judge and someone, like Jean from my class. I thought, "Well, I'm saved." but they weren't really helping me.
	  
	  I woke.
