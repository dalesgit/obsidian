	- Gini continues today very weak. MP keeps saying I can't believe she's working so hard to breath.
	  
	  It was exciting for me to meet nurse Jenny at the house. She had the day shift. It was a long time before I even heard her talk. She wore a mask and I couldn't see her very well. But then when I heard her speak I was startled. She had the appearance and the voice of Kapono. Finally I introduced myself and asked where she was from. She said Malaysia. She made me feel homesick for Hawaii. She originally trained as a concert pianist. Married a childhood sweetheart and followed him to Ohio. She's been her 35 years I think she said.
	  
	  The siblings have shared letters that their father wrote Gini. One, from just after they were married and while he was in Ohio and she remained in Miami, was quite amazing. It spoke in detail of a dream he had that was similar to a near-death experience. His love for Gini was tender and powerful. Unlike anything I've ever encountered. I was envious.
	  
	  Col. Tom 100 y/o has died but inspired all kinds of handicapped kids to raise $. Christopher Plummer has died. It all seems so personal.
