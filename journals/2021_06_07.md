	  Catherine coming tomorrow night. Reported from call with me.
	  
	  They may be open to my coming to St. Paul's. StPauls What she's mostly concerned with is "Rector Search". Search seems to be where the vestry is.
	  
	  Thursday: cathartic, 18 from diocese, 30 from church, regional canons volunteered to do Sunday this month. Charlotte would like me to start Sunday after next. 6-8 breakout groups. "They need a rudder and they are hurting."
	  
	  A search, Charlotte thinks, expect 6 months - 1 year. Charlotte can fill in from Charlotte and diocese. The sooner we can have 1 leader the better. Catherine will want to talk about what they can afford. Parish doesn't know but the vestry does know that they have received a bequest for $100,000.
	  
	  Brad came perhaps under misunderstanding: staff, volunteers.
	  
	  Charlotte would maybe like twice a month Eucharist by August.
	  
	  She tends to agree
