	  We met Sean's "new family" at dinner last night. Then a KKK redemption story *Burden* tonight. Burden was his name but the notion of shedding your burdens was a part of the theme. It seemed throughout to integrate with Sean's story. [I didn't tell that to Mary Pat.] I did tell her about how I resonated with the part of Forest Whitaker (playing a Rev. David Kennedy) from Laurens, SC. shades of Bp. Kennedy's son, the betrayals he enacted at Holy Nativity in defense of the bishop â€“ Bob Fitzpatrick. I said to Mary Pat that I had imagined a role something like David's if I had stayed in Hawai'i. I think +Bob even suggested it. ValuesofSociety
