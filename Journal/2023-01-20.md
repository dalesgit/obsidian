Living a life where even when you do something as grand as our trip, when you get back nothing has really changed.

## Enigmas

You've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with  
his golden feet?  
I reply, the ocean knows this.  
You say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent  
bell? What is it waiting for?  
I tell you it is waiting for time, like you.  
You ask me whom the Macrocystis alga hugs in its arms?  
Study, study it, at a certain hour, in a certain sea I know.  
You question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal,  
and I reply by describing  
how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies.  
You enquire about the kingfisher's feathers,  
which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides?  
Or you've found in the cards a new question touching on  
the crystal architecture  
of the sea anemone, and you'll deal that to me now?  
You want to understand the electric nature of the ocean  
spines?  
The armored stalactite that breaks as it walks?  
The hook of the angler fish, the music stretched out  
in the deep places like a thread in the water?

I want to tell you the ocean knows this, that life in its  
jewel boxes  
is endless as the sand, impossible to count, pure,  
and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the  
petal  
hard and shiny, made the jellyfish full of light  
and untied its knot, letting its musical threads fall  
from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl.  
I am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead  
of human eyes, dead in those darknesses,  
of fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitudes  
on the timid globe of an orange.  
I walked around as you do, investigating  
the endless star,  
and in my net, during the night, I woke up naked,  
the only thing caught, a fish trapped inside the wind

## Gautama Christ

The names of God and especially those of His representative  
Who is called Jesus or Christ according to holy books and  
someone's mouth  
These names have been used, worn out and left  
On the shores of rivers of of human lives  
Like the empty shells of a mollusk.  
However when we touch these sacred but exhausted  
Names, these wounded scattered petals  
Which have come out of the oceans of love and fear  
Something still remains, a sip of water,  
A rainbow footprint that still shimmers in the light.  
While the names of God were used  
By the best and the worst, by the clean and the dirty  
By the white and the black, by bloody murderers  
And by victims flaming gold with napalm  
While Nixon with his hands  
Of Cain blessed those whom he condemned to death,  
While fewer and fewer divine footprints were found  
on the beach  
People began to study colors,  
The future of honey, the sign of uranium  
They looked with anxiety and hope for the possibilities  
Of killing themselves or not killing themselves, of organizing  
themselves into a fabric  
Of going further on, of breaking through limits without stopping  
What we came across in these blood thirsty times  
With their smoke of burning trash, their dead ashes  
As we weren't able to stop looking  
We often stopped to look at the names of God  
We lifted them with tenderness because they reminded us  
Of our ancestors, of the first people, those who said the prayers  
Those who discovered the hymn that united them in misfortune  
And now seeing the empty fragments which sheltered those  
ancient people  
We feel those smooth substances,  
Worn out and used up by good and by evil.


## Here 
I Love You

## by Pablo Neruda

Pablo Neruda  
Here I love you.  
In the dark pines the wind disentangles itself.  
The moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters.  
Days, all one kind, go chasing each other.  
The snow unfurls in dancing figures.  
A silver gull slips down from the west.  
Sometimes a sail. High, high stars.  
Oh the black cross of a ship.  
Alone.  
Sometimes I get up early and even my soul is wet.  
Far away the sea sounds and resounds.  
This is a port.  
Here I love you.  
Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain.  
I love you still among these cold things.  
Sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels  
that cross the sea towards no arrival.  
I see myself forgotten like those old anchors.  
The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there.  
My life grows tired, hungry to no purpose.  
I love what I do not have. You are so far.  
My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights.  
But night comes and starts to sing to me.  
The moon turns its clockwork dream.  
The biggest stars look at me with your eyes.  
And as I love you, the pines in the wind  
want to sing your name with their leaves of wire
