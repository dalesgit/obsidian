# Notes
1. Almighty and everlasting God, who in the Paschal mystery established the new covenant of reconciliation: Grant that all who have been reborn into the fellowship of Christ's Body may show forth in their lives what they profess by their faith; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. _Amen._
2. Peter's address to the people being astonished: summary of gospel.
3. Jesus's appearance.  

> Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things."

## Eucharist
Holy God,
Holy and Mighty,
Holy Immortal One,
_Have mercy upon us._
## Creed
Say something re. Nicene Creed. Standing. [summary available](https://www.fourthcentury.com/nicaea-325-canons/)

Beatitudes?

Canon of Nicea: (last canon) Since there are some who kneel on Sunday and during the season of Pentecost, this holy synod decrees that, so that the same observances may be maintained in every diocese, one should offer one’s prayers to the Lord standing.

### The Beatitudes

**5** When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. $^2$ And he began to speak and taught them, saying:

<sup>3</sup> “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

$^4$ “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

$^5$ “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

$^6$ “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

$^7$ “Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.

$^8$ “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

$^9$ “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.

<sup>10</sup> “Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

<sup>11</sup> “Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
## Laying on of hands

Savior of the world, by your cross and precious blood you have redeemed us;  
_Save us and help us, we humbly beseech you, O Lord._

_The Priest then lays hands upon the sick person, and says one of the following_

N., I lay my hands upon you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, beseeching our Lord Jesus Christ to sustain you with his presence, to drive away all sickness of body and spirit, and to give you that victory of life and peace which will enable you to serve him both now and evermore. _Amen._
