Top 3 Reasons To Book

-   The bustling frontier town of Punta Arenas
-   Cerro La Cruz viewpoint; Plaza de Armas
-   The Braun-Menéndez Mansion; a cheese empanadita snack

Breathtaking personal fortunes have been made and lost in Patagonia. Today you’ll learn how they were made, by whom, and the resulting legacy of hardworking men and women. 

Board your coach for a sightseeing drive around the bustling frontier town of **Punta Arenas** -- capital of the Magallanes Region. Discover the charm of this southernmost city in the world, situated on the Strait of Magellan. 

Sometimes, the best place to start delving into the lives of historical figures is at the cemetery that became their final resting place. Punta Arenas’ **pioneer cemetery** features avenues lined with tall cypress trees and splendid mausoleums. Cross the cemetery to see the tomb of Sara Braun -- the wealthiest woman in Patagonia’s history -- and to hear about her amazing life. 

Drive to **Cerro La Cruz** -- a viewpoint over the city, the Strait of Magellan, the port, and the legendary Tierra del Fuego Island, which was once home to the Fireland natives. 

Stop at the Plaza de Armas main square in town and visit the **Braun-Menéndez Mansion**. This National Monument was designed and built by renowned French architect Antoine Beaulier in 1906. The mansion is a well-preserved example of how affluent families lived at the turn of the 20th century and contains all its original furniture, décor and memorabilia. 

Visit the district of old warehouses, which belonged to wealthy sheep farmers. You will hear the epic story of the settlement of Punta Arenas and enjoy a beverage and a cheese empanadita **snack** -- a typical stuffed turnover that is a savory delight. A demonstration exhibits a little bit of the agricultural skill that has brought fame and fortune to Patagonia. 

A little more knowledgeable about the life of the forebears of the present inhabitants of Punta Arenas, you’ll return to the pier.

**Notes:**

It is essential that you wear warm, layered clothing to fully enjoy and participate in this excursion; outer layer should be waterproof and windproof. Bring gloves, a warm hat and a scarf. Wear comfortable walking shoes.
