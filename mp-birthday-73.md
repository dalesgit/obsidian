Oh, the places we've been. The wonder. The awe.  
Beyond imagining. Maybe yours as well  
It should be **awesome** for one and all  
To pass this way but once,   
no practice, no do-overs, this one time  
to make a song from chance and chaos, mis-direction and purpose,  
This song of grace. 

> "This is my song, O God of all the nations,  
a song of peace for lands afar and mine;  
this is my home, the country where my heart is;  
here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine:  
but other hearts in other lands are beating  
with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine."[^1]

You've been through this year  
The 72nd cycle, a remarkable number,  
The atomic number of *hafnium*,  
"room temperature",  
The number of translators of the *Septuagint*,  
The number sent by Jesus in Luke 10,  
Par for 18 holes of golf.  
And we've made 2 moves,  
Sold a home, bought a home.

Your face shone with gratitude and gladness  
As you hosted dinner party after dinner party,  
Nourished friendships,  
All through the lens of Covid.

But this year upcoming.  
The one we haven't met yet,  
It is in fact beyond compare.

The 21<sup>st</sup> prime,
The 4<sup>th</sup> star number
$$S_n=6n(n-1)+1$$
(*Something* rhymes with won.)

In the 1940 NFL championship game,  
the Bears beat the Redskins 73–0,  
(*The Redskins won their previous regular season game*,  
7–3)[^2]

> Today is your day.  
You're off to Great Places!  
You're off and away!

> OH!  
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO! [^3]

You've come home, girl,  
After doing your piece to save  
The pedagogy of mathematics in this brave land.  
We anticipate buckets and buckets  
Of things to do before you die,  
Around *Cape Horn* and *penguins*,  
Who could ask for more?

Somewhere in God's plans --
Way mo' bigger than our plans --  
A son is making plans beyond imagining
Oh so shortly ago.

God's **serendipity** prevents us getting too familiar  
with the places you'll go.  
God's **grace** fuels your formidable smile.

It is "Yes, yes." And "Thank you, thank you."
We'll be on our way.
