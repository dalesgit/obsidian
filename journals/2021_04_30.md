	  My $50K life insurance with Church Pension. MP presumes that she is the beneficiary if I die first. But she suggests "Lydia as a contingent beneficiary in case both of us die together. $50k is a small amount and rather than divide it up give to the one who has the largest clump of financial needs." I'm not sure I wouldn't include Julian, and Emma if she ever decided to talk to me.
	  
	  Change this with Pension Fund.
	  
	  Also change the moving allowance: now it says MP as primary, then Owen, Julian, Miriam are contingent recipients. Probably make children primary: divide 4 ways, 5 ways?

	  Reproduce the passion and energy of my ad lib words at today's funeral for Kay & her husband. It was old stuff, but just simply vocalized. It was good.
