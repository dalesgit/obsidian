## Journal Entries
-  We watched the National Cathedral service today. It's been a while. There was so much about what they did that was exquisite. The filming. The sermon. The non-hymnal music. The soloist on the Gaither song. 
- I had taken a look at the livestream of **Our Lady of Lourdes** here in Monroe. It was quite depressing. So clerical. Punctual and performative without a sense of grace and humanity.
- Both MP & I got things accomplished in the packing. The cleaner is scheduled. The cross-stitch resources were organized and boxed. I packed up the computer on the desk.
- It was Pentecost. I emailed each of the children.
- I started over with my Linux container on the Asus. I did pretty good getting the basic pieces back into place. Markdown-index. The various config files that were helpful to have backed up (rclone, ranger)

## Gratitude
- for the lessons on **mythology**. He speaks so passionately about the **meaning** of the myths. Categorized. Examined with sets of tools (toolkits).
- for our time here in Monroe, friends made, hospitality. The lesson on the importance of laughter -- (Larry Helms, "[[where's-the-joy?]]")
