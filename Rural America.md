# Can Anything Be Done to Assuage Rural Rage?

Rural resentment has become a central fact of American politics — in particular, a pillar of support for the rise of right-wing extremism. As the Republican Party has moved ever further into MAGAland, it has lost votes among educated suburban voters; but this has been offset by a drastic rightward shift in rural areas, which in some places has gone so far that the Democrats who remain face intimidation and are [afraid](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-elections-pennsylvania-lifestyle-election-2020-fc79679ef54d850c0245f96dac37456c) to reveal their party affiliation.

But is this shift permanent? Can anything be done to assuage rural rage?

The answer will depend on two things: whether it’s possible to improve rural lives and restore rural communities, and whether the voters in these communities will give politicians credit for any improvements that do take place.

This week my colleague Thomas B. Edsall [surveyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/opinion/rural-voters-republican-realignment.html) research on the rural Republican shift. I was struck by his summary of work by [Katherine J. Cramer](https://press.uchicago.edu/dam/ucp/books/pdf/course_intro/978-0-226-34911-4_course_intro.pdf), who attributes rural resentment to perceptions that rural areas are ignored by policymakers, don’t get their fair share of resources and are disrespected by “city folks.”

As it happens, all three perceptions are largely wrong. I’m sure that my saying this will generate a tidal wave of hate mail, and lecturing rural Americans about policy reality isn’t going to move their votes. Nonetheless, it’s important to get our facts straight.

The truth is that ever since the New Deal rural America has received special treatment from policymakers. It’s not just farm subsidies, which [ballooned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/us/politics/trump-farmers-subsidies.html) under Donald Trump to the point where they accounted for around 40 percent of total farm income. Rural America also benefits from [special programs](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/agriculture/rural-subsidies) that support housing, utilities and business in general.

In terms of resources, major federal programs disproportionately benefit rural areas, in part because such areas have a disproportionate number of seniors receiving Social Security and Medicare. But even means-tested programs — programs that Republicans often disparage as “welfare” — tilt rural. Notably, at this point rural Americans are more likely than urban Americans to be on [Medicaid](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-role-of-medicaid-in-rural-america/) and receive [food stamps](https://www.naco.org/articles/rural-areas-see-highest-snap-participation).

And because rural America is poorer than urban America, it pays much less per person in federal taxes, so in practice major metropolitan areas hugely subsidize the countryside. These subsidies don’t just support incomes, they support economies: Government and the so-called health care and social assistance sector each [employ more people](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/105155/eib-246.pdf?v=5161.4#page=12) in rural America than agriculture, and what do you think pays for those jobs?

What about rural perceptions of being disrespected? Well, many people have negative views about people with different lifestyles; that’s human nature. There is, however, an unwritten rule in American politics that it’s OK for politicians to seek rural votes by insulting big cities and their residents, but it would be unforgivable for urban politicians to return the favor. “I have to go to New York City soon,” [tweeted](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/j-d-vance-s-twitter-trolling-new-york-city-trump-ncna1273888)J.D. Vance during his senatorial campaign. “I have heard it’s disgusting and violent there.” Can you imagine, say, Chuck Schumer saying something similar about rural Ohio, even as a joke?

So the ostensible justifications for rural resentment don’t withstand scrutiny — but that doesn’t mean things are fine. A changing economy has increasingly favored metropolitan areas with large college-educated work forces over small towns. The rural working-age population has been [declining](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/105155/eib-246.pdf?v=5161.4#page=10), leaving seniors behind. Rural men in their prime working years are [much more likely](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/male-prime-age-nonworkers-evidence-from-the-nlsy97.htm) than their metropolitan counterparts to not be working. Rural woes are real.

Ironically, however, the policy agenda of the party most rural voters support would make things even worse, slashing the safety-net programs these voters depend on. And Democrats shouldn’t be afraid to point this out.

But can they also have a positive agenda for rural renewal? As The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent recently [pointed out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/25/biden-place-based-industrial-policy-muro/), the infrastructure spending bills enacted under President Biden, while primarily intended to address climate change, will also create large numbers of blue-collar jobs in rural areas and small cities. They are, in practice, a form of the “place-based industrial policy” some economists have urged to fight America’s growing geographic disparities.

Will they work? The economic forces that have been hollowing out rural America are deep and not easily countered. But it’s certainly worth trying.

But even if these policies improve rural fortunes, will Democrats get any credit? It’s easy to be cynical. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the new governor of Arkansas, has [pledged](https://apnews.com/article/sarah-huckabee-sanders-politics-arkansas-state-government-f8b8627b06b3ef8fac85900aaa39434d) to get the “bureaucratic tyrants” of Washington “out of your wallets”; in 2019 the federal government spent almost [twice as much](https://rockinst.org/issue-areas/fiscal-analysis/balance-of-payments-portal/) in Arkansas as it collected in taxes, de facto providing the average Arkansas resident with $5,500 in aid. So even if Democratic policies greatly improve rural lives, will rural voters notice?

Still, anything that helps reverse rural America’s decline would be a good thing in itself. And maybe, just maybe, reducing the heartland’s economic desperation will also help reverse its political radicalization.
