Key moments continue in tomorrow's lecture

"Unlocking the Icehouse" (10,30am Feb 31st)

## 5 lectures
- The key moments
1. Finding Antarctica
2. When there were trees
3. The final piece in a global jesaw puzle
4. When and how did Antarctica get its ice sheet?
5. Oh no! It turns out the ice sheet is unstable
- Cook saw rocks in ice so knew there was land somewhere
- Bellinshausen first to see continent

## Heroic age of exploration

### QUEST FOR THE SOUTH POLE

- Shackleton (1908-091
- Amundsen (1911-12)
- Soon 1811-12
- Byrd (1929)
- Fuchs (1951-14)


#### Captain Robert Falcon Scott

-   ﻿﻿Naval officer, formal, hierarchical
-   ﻿First scientific Investigations
-   ﻿First to find south magnetic pole
-   ﻿Second to reach South Pole

Expeditions, 1901-1904 Discovery;

1910-1913 Terra Nova.

#### Sir Ernest Shackleton

-   ﻿Explorer, great leader & role model
-   ﻿Farthest south 1908 - Nimrod
-   ﻿Famous for 1914-1917 falled Trans  
    Antarctic Expedition with HMS

#### Roald Amundsen

-   ﻿Hardened polar explorer
-   ﻿First to reach South Pole 14° Dec, 1911 after traversing from the Bay of Whales
-   ﻿Fram expedition.

## Notes
- Scott's body included a fossil of ancient tree.
- 280 million years. Gondwanan forests. 
- Knowledge really 50 million years ago. Just add Gonwanaland began to pull apart. 
- 14 mill years no water and bitter cold
- Scientist can date volcanic ash. They found it in their drilling. 
- Trees 400 ppm co2. Pre industrial ppm 280
- Gondwanaland began ca. 100 mill years ago
- Beech trees had common ancestor in Gonwanaland
- 34 mill years first ice sheets. Work done inn 70s 80s
- Ice shelves are melting fast over last 30 years
- Antarctica rising temperatures more rapidly than other places
