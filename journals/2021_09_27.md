	  Watching *New Amsterdam* tonight. Helen and Max consummate their love. They have mutually expressed their love and devotion. Yet it seems doomed from the beginning. She is called to London.
	  
	  Why my attraction to them? Why do they seem so personal for me? Identification with Max? Beauty of Helen?
	  
	  I don't know.

	  “To be of the Earth is to know
	  the restlessness of being a seed
	  the darkness of being planted
	  the struggle toward the light
	  the pain of growth into the light
	  the joy of bursting and bearing fruit
	  the love of being food for someone
	  the scattering of your seeds
	  the decay of the seasons
	  the mystery of death and
	  the miracle of birth.”
