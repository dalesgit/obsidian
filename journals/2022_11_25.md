- Need to call Becky [[becky-friedenberg]] today. There will be time alone while MP gets her nails done. Then later today we have lunch with the kids [[Sean]] & [[amy]]. Later still some time with the Judges.
  
  At least I feel better than I did yesterday. [[Peter-Lane]] gave a moving Thanksgiving Day homily that is repeated in the newsletter. "Giving thanks in all things," referencing the Rwandan holocaust.
- Phone call to Becky.
	- She's on her way to help set up church for Advent. Maybe later today. Maybe later this weekend.
	- [[mia]] sends her greetings (she would have been there for Thanksgiving.) Sweet.
