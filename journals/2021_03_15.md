	- dream featured Lydia. We were at the same event. It was church related. It reminds me of **New Beginnings** or **Happening**. Somehow things were falling apart. People leaving. Some kind of misbehavior. Towards the end the group turned on Lydia. She was rejected and had to go. My reaction was swift and strong. Up to that point I had tried to have a "hands-off" approach to her. But when I saw the group turn on her I was furious. I made clear that I would defend her at all costs. Perhaps we left together.
	  
	  Reflecting on it as I am awake, I ask myself, "When did Lydia turn on me?" I remember when the girls and I had stayed in Hawai'i while Bridget went to her family. Lydia's depression came to a head and I helped her to get a counseling appointment. A woman. When Lydia related some of what happened at her session, I remember so vividly being surprised at the anger she had towards me. But I absorbed it and was so grateful that she was moving forward. I took her to several sessions before Bridget appeared back on the scene. Then suddenly everything shifted. Bridget was orchestrating things. Bridget led in such a way that Lydia was soon on medication.
	  
	  It has felt like I lost her at that time.
