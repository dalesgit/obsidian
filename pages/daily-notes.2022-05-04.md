Woke up from a dream set in Hawai'i. I was a part of a workshop of some kind. That was the familiar part. There were pieces of familiar themes:
- there were evangelicals who knew it all, repeating tired formulae
- I was trying to fit in and not succeeding

But there was something different. I wasn't a part of the church. There were no bishops or authority figures. I got to the waking part and I felt free.

Anxiety was prompted by anxiety that I had missed my evening pills [2022-05-03](2022-05-03.md) and I didn't know where they were. I thought perhaps I forgot them. Plotting how I would deal with that circumstance.

Talking with Joe:
- Henry Drummond: *The greatest thing is love* (Scottish)
- [[francis-chan]]: *Until / Unity*.

Leads me to wonder about where I am right now? [[where-i-am-may-4]]
