Today I felt satisfied with the conversation with Beck F. in WA.

- settled on a purpose to facilitate her EFM questions
- I told her something about MP and my meeting and marrying. She seemed a little bit over the top in her "thanksgiving" that I met someone and it is complete enoughy that we pray together etc. (as I shared with her.)
- Fr. Peter called and asked if I would be interested in being a kind of mentor/advocate for "Manny" at St. Alfred. He is seeked Holy Orders. He is "on the spectrum."
- Julian is ordering a flight for 2nd week in November
- We are spending Thanksgiving in Rock Hill. Perhaps going on to Dayton
- MP got the $1,000 and gratuities paid for and ??
