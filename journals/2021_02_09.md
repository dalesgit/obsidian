	- I arrived at the Mass vaccination site at about four minutes after eight. At that point they were maybe hundred to 150 cars in line. National Guard troops our traffic control.
	  
	  By 830 I have received my vaccine. There was some mixup about find me my name. At one point I ended up with two vaccination cards. That was cleared up and Iâ€™m now waiting with other cars for the 15 minutes or so.
	  
	  I asked one of the soldiers why the change of venue. He answered that a batch of vaccine have been lost or spoiled intended for the appointments of yesterday. That meant having to do twice as many today.
