	  Filed an article of insights from Lao Tzu:
	  
	  1. "The Tao invariably takes no action, and yet there is nothing left undone."
	  1. "He who is contented is rich."
	  1. "Thirty spokes make a wheel, but it is the empty center that makes it work."
	  1. "To know that you do not know is the best. To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease."
	  1. "The journey of a thousand miles starts from where one stands."
