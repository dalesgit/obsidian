### Goodbyes
This is not an easy letter for me to write. It's not just that "goodbyes" are often difficult. When one has loved and given of oneself, it is saying goodbye to a part of what makes us who we are. 

I have said "Goodbye" to St. Paul's on two previous times. The first was in 2017 when you were seeking a rector the last time. When you chose him, I said "goodbye" with the full understanding that Mary Pat and I would be back to visit. We had laughed together and prayed together, two activities that I think bind persons together. When Fr. Jim got sick we returned to fill in while he took a leave of absence. Then Covid happened. When he returned, even in the midst of pandemic, Mary Pat and I said "goodbye" again. As is all too recent in our memory, Fr. Jim didn't get well. We accepted the invitation to be a "part-time, interim" priest in charge. We moved to Monroe.  Now, under somewhat different circumstances we say it again.

This time it is different

Not all of you are aware that in 2019 Mary Pat and I traveled to Florida for 5 weeks, intending to decided where we wanted to move in our "true" retirement. Then Covid happened. The plan to move to Florida had been a part of our conversations ever since we moved to the mainland from Hawai'i. As 2022 began, in our own prayer and "heart of hearts," it became increasingly clear to us that the time was approaching when we needed to make our planned move. It had to do with our unyielding aging process. It had to do with a sense that we had done what we could at St. Paul's. Clearly we would serve out our agreed upon term of 9 months, but now was the time to move.

That time has now come.

### Best practices
I have been a rector or priest-in-charge before, but always for extended periods, stretching into many years. I was certainly familiar with the dynamics and "best practices" when leaving a place one had served for over 10 years. It felt different to me, here at St. Paul's, because my tenure here had not been "normal", at least as I had previously experienced it. The policy of the diocese, however was clear.

> • After you leave, you will no longer be able to function as their pastor or  priest; it no longer will be your role to officiate at their baptisms, weddings,  and funerals. 
> • You will be withdrawing from social interaction and other parts of the “life of  the congregation” including social media so the congregation can move  forward. 
> • You will be absent from the life of the congregation for at least one year after  the arrival of your successor, after which you may come back only at the  invitation of your successors (*Interim and next Vicar/Rector*) and then, you  will attend as their former pastor.  

### "Healing"
We had made the move to Monroe to serve St. Paul's with the clear conviction that this was an exceptional congregation, that we had loved and been loved, and that God had called us. Some within the congregation talked of the need for healing. I think there has been healing. Some talked of a "presence." We have done our best to be present. Like the rest of the world, we have experienced the inexorable impact of global pandemic. But we have persisted. Both Mary Pat and I have tried to be faithful to God's calling. 

None of this was possible or imaginable without the Grace of God. It is God's work in the end that matters. It is a happy circumstance that we make our last goodbye in the Easter season. Though Fridays often happen, Sundays are three days later. "Sunday's comin'." 

Alleluia! The Lord is Risen.
