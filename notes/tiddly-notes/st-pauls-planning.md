# St. Paul's

# Planning for upcoming

Drive-through communion for some would be possible.

We are establishing yet another **New normal** and so we could consider new possibilities for communion – **how to be church**.

Likelihood is that the short-term disability would run through Easter.

# Where they've been the past weeks / months.

Jim wanted to get a livestream from nave to gathering room. They've done it though they haven't implemented it. They could now livestream to gathering room – reaching communion for 20.

They had 2 good outdoor eucharists with ca. 40-35. Indoor in Parish Hall began strong with ca. 20, but it dropped off quickly. The notion of having the church open for limited meditation and even for Kathleen's music performance did not elicit much.

Charlotte is just informally continuing as Sr. Warden. Diocesan guidelines prescribe rotating off after a year. But they are aware of the ad hoc plans to continue.
