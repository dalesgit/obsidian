- A poignant oped from a man who was adopted and objects to those people who ask him if he was glad that his birth-mother had decided to deliver him. He argues that it is all about **choice**. Choice all around. He finally met a half-brother after 30 years and was able to talk about their birth-mother. He discovered also that they were both gay.
