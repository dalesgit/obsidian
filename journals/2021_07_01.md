	  Dinner with Larry & Kathryn Helms:
	  
	  * I am why he still attends St. Paul's – because I make him think
	  * animosity toward Kathleen – discrepancy between Nicci paid and Kathleen
	  * until recently Kathleen was salary @23,000 per year – and she is an attorney working ½ time
	  * long-time bitterness about the removal of cushions (for Kathleen who was told organ tech that it would improve acoustics)
	  * Kathryn: attraction is 1) no music 2) time early on Sunday 3) (rite 1) not important
	  * Larry: bread/wine & message from clergy
	  * Larry said repeatedly that my sermon from last Sunday was beyond good
	  * 2 miracles that have powered Larry's life: 1) the recovery of a walking stick while fishing – further down-river 2) dogs that alerted him about 2 deer, but there were no dogs.
	  * what does the Episcopal Church offer the world around us? I heard from the two of them tonight the testimony of a place that accepts all kinds – that bridges the differences – in spite of the differences that divide us!
	  * Brad had designated him as Senior Warden to be – confirmed by vestry
	  * he reports much of 8am service has left – mostly for secondary reasons
