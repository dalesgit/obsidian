## Drawing on Memories

When I traveled to Japan in my early thirties, I began an adventure unlike anything I had ever experienced. I had been invited to help set up a new Catechetical Center for the Kyoto Diocese and knew no one there, not even the Maryknoll sisters with whom I would be living. Everything was new and different, affecting me deeply and inviting me to place my trust in God’s abiding presence.

It was a significant challenge to live in a country in which Christians were a small minority. At the same time, I learned so much about the call to contemplation as I explored Zen Buddhist and Shinto practices. For the first time in my life, I was challenged to examine my Christian faith in more depth, experiencing both the “agony and ecstasy” Paul speaks of in today’s first reading. I recognized my own lack of faith and my defensiveness as I tried to share my beliefs. And yet, I remembered with delight that God was with me, leading the way. Drawing on these memories of God’s accompaniment throughout my life has brought me deep peace, especially during times when I am anxious or worried.

The worries and anxieties of this past year are unlike anything most of us have ever experienced. Hard as it can be to do, it is important to remember God’s abiding love, to reflect on God’s care for all the earth and heed the invitation of Jesus to trust: “. . . will not God much more provide for you, O you of little faith?”
