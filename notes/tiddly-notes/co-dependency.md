# codependency

I connected this with the fact that we stopped going to bed together some time after Sean came. It makes sense that I would grieve the loss of that – and all the other things that we always did and now don't. I washing dishes because that's what I do – out of love. It's now a chore that usually she controls who does it.

The change of  night time habits was a part of the conflict of last week that we processed with TKaren.
