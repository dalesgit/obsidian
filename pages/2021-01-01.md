	  Phone call from Bill in the evening, returning Mary Pat's call from yesterday. The one piece of news that he had to pass on was a link that he/Karla had received and I didn't, that Owen was finally going to have his surgery on Jan 16
	  
	- Bill wanted to alert me to how impressed he and Karla had been at hearing Michael Curry on PBS Newshour this evening. We'll have to listen.
