## Precious daughter
Since the 70's my first instinct was to root for the girls over the boys.
	  
Fathers and daughters. Fathers and sons. I have wrestled with my relationship with my parents. I have tried to be sensitive to the dynamics I see in others.
	  
My teacher at Notre Dame, John S. Dunne, told me once that one's spiritual life didn't begin until both parents were gone. His whole career had been built on pulling his broad Catholic spirituality and mysticism out of the clouds and into the stuff of every day life. I heard from someone that in the 70's, when students enrolled in the fall, there were a myriad tables spread out -- you know what I mean, labeled "A-Az", "B-Bz", and so on. There in the cavernous geodesic dome, there would be one table set aside as "Prof. John Dunne."

Isaac was fooled (was he already a fool in his old age?) by his wife Rebeccah and son Jacob to bestow the blessing on the someday named "Israel" instead of the hairy eldest, Esau.
	  
Since my own childhood, I have spontaneously rooted for the underdog. Did I see myself as a perennial underdog? Did it seem all the more magnificent when the undervalued prevailed?
	  
It seems related to an old adage that a parent loves each of their children in the way that they need loving at any particular moment. It was intended to defeat the claim of one child or another that they were the "favorite".
	  
Emma was the last child I sired. The baby, as it were. I am writing this memory, because this last of my children has been the subject of more anguish than any of the others. It is because she was special, I guess, in some way.

## Conception
So much of her early life there was a swirling around me, a roller coaster of up and down. I spent lots of energy trying to re-vitalize a congregation. I spent energy throughout the week trying to nurture a step-son. He accompanied me to church on school days because he attended just across the street at the Catholic School. That lasted until it was time for middle school.…
## Birth
I was determined to be present at the birth of Emma. I had been forced from the delivery/operating room with Lydia when the spinal block failed. My response wasn't exactly, "You don't know who I am." But something like, "You really don't know who I am." I knew of myself that I could take any amount of chaos and emergency and I would not faint and would not cause trouble. Of course, hospital protocol prevailed. But for Emma, I was determined that that wouldn't be repeated	

So I was present for the birth of 4 of my 5 children. 
	
Nothing was unusual in the several days that it took for Emma's mother to recover. Then we prepared to head home. Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes. Mother in the mandatory wheel chair. Then off to the elevator. As soon as we entered a loud alarm went off throughout the floor -- perhaps the whole building. The doors froze and there was no going up or down. 
  
A nurse had forgot to clip off the identification bracelet on Emma's ankle. That was my Emma.

## Fathering
When Lydia had come home from the hospital, Bridget seemed to have difficulty knowing what a mother was to do. I felt like Mo had taught me something of that and I tried to step in. Perhaps Bridget resented me for that. I was something of a "La Leche League" coach for her. Encouraging her in ways that I had learned from earlier experiences. I "mothered" Lydia in significant ways. I was the one who could quiet her at night. I took pride – that's an observation to be wary of – being able to sooth her at night, put her to sleep in my arms, comfort her when nothing else or no one else could accomplish it.
	  
Emma was a different story. Her mother was a little more confident in her ability to nurse. I now needed to pay even more attention to Lydia as Bridget was focused on her new-born. I felt an inner pressure to open my heart to Emma in compensation for the extra time I spent with Lydia. It was right and proper that Emma's mother be the primary care-giver at this point

And so it was that I began what I thought would be an innocent time of fathering and nurturing two little girls. They shared a bedroom then. Emma in a crib and Lydia in the "big girl" bed. I solidified my deepest intention to be the best father ever. I thought I knew deep within that I could do it by growing a love within me like an oak tree or baobab tree. I read, I fed, I rocked, and read stories. Lydia seemed to naturally melt into my arms after only a few minutes of rocking. Emma, on the other hand, seemed to demonstrate a "strong will" from the beginning. When she was upset there seemed to be now way to get past it with gentleness. She would fall asleep after she was exhausted. Again and again.
	  
I changed diapers and gave them baths. I was conscious of being a male in a female dominated family. I was ultra-sensitive to gender issues as related to privacy and appropriateness. This was made especially present to me as it was during these years that the church was increasing at great speed it's awareness of and sensitivity to abuse issues. From the beginning of my marriage to Bridget I was aware that my approach to relationships was vastly different from hers. The differences were manifest in the way we approached parenting. I was utterly committed to a mutuality and sharing of parental roles. My sense was that Bridget [[Bridget]] was far more committed to traditional roles of fathering and mothering.
	  
Does it make any difference so many years later that both my mother [[Mom]] and my brother [[Bill]] thought that Bridget and I were mis-matched and inappropriately wed? If I had known how skeptical they were in 1991, would it have made any difference?
	  
One little illustration of my parenting with Emma was a sort of game we had as I took her into her preschool. When I took her out of her car seat I would hoist her onto my shoulders and we would proceed into the front doors, ducking because with her height above me we didn't fit the doorway. How little I could have suspected where that little gesture would lead.

## The Police?

It seems impossible to reconstruct at this late date. But it seemed unbelievable even as I was living it. 

I arrived at her school to pick her up and was informed that she wasn't there or that she wasn't available for me to see. In some mechanism that I can't remember now I was informed that she had been placed in some kind of "protective custody." As I write this almost 30 years later it seems like it must be about someone else. I remember frantic converstion with "authorities" that moved quickly from embarrasment to outrage. By Sunday at an interview with a police detective at our home, it was clearer that someone at Emma's daycare had reported suspicious behavior that led to initial questioning of Emma that led to the conclusion that this was a case where reporting the suspicion of child abuse was required. 

At a later conversation I had with the director of the daycare, it was revealed that the person who started the whole cascade of vicious official action was a South American raised daycare assistant who had recently attended a required training session. She had observed me habitually carrying Emma into the daycare on my shoulders and that seemed inappropriate to her. Questioning Emma led to "discoveries" that I sometimes had oversight of Emma's bathing at night time. Not very surprising since I was often the only parent available 

There are the things that I can remember as the facts of the case. As I have learned over and over again in my years, memories of one person can easily divert from another's rendition. As I write this some 24 years later, I have been hearing repeatedly on our ship's MSNBC channel a news anchor cry out, "We live in a post-fact world." For years I have heard from students and others making reference to "my truth", or "one person's truth is not the same as another person's truth." I am old enough to have absorbed a classical and long-lived understanding that **truth** is not something changing, but in fact everlasting. 

It was in my 11<sup>th</sup> grade American History class that I experienced one of the important conversions of my life.  We had been assigned the rather simple sounding task of determining who had fired the "shot heard round the world." Our **evidence** was provided for us in the form of 6-7 testimonial statements about what happened at Lexington - Concord that day. They ranged from next day reports in a news story to letters written through the years and an auto-biography from decades later. The evidence was, of course, conflicting. It was the thing that left me thirsty for **history** the rest of my life. It is the thing that helped me fashion an understanding of history as primarily **story**. It is at the heart of a later conviction, fashioned in doctoral seminars at Notre Dame University, that all of our talk about God (**theology**) is essentially metaphorical. At whimsical times that leads me to claim that the most significant human language, the language that is closest to God, is poetry. Where is the poetry in lies that lead to the alienation of a child from her parent?

But how am I to apply those convictions in this particular case? It would seem that among the "stories" that Emma's mother passed on to her after our separation and divorce is at least something along the lines of "where there's smoke there must be fire." Perhaps the fabrications have been more explicit than that? I don't know because I have never been able to get an explanation from anyone in a position to know. 

In fact it seems astonishing to me that a child could break a relationship with a parent and that parent know so little about what caused the rupture. This is what I know.So much else is conjecture on my part.

1. My bishop in Hawaii told me that he knew Bridget had told our girls things that, in his words, "No parent should tell a child."
2. My brother David had a number of conversations with Emma over the years and at one point he told her that her words don't match the Dale that he knows.
3. At Emma's graduation, a long time friend of the family, Tim Vail, came walking up to me in a very aggressive manner. He spoke to me, intending to intimidate me, saying, "Don't you ever hurt Emma!"

> I was startled because I had no idea what he was talking about. What I know these many decades later is that at that moment that there was no one in the universe less likely to intentionally hurt Emma than her father. 
> 
> My initial thought was that he was acting from some unspeakable deception. I thought, "How dare him!" I spent some time and energy with my spiritual director, trying to work out what to do with that information. At one time I had thought of him as a friend. As with much of this affair I have felt a good bit of betrayal. As it seems increasingly likely that I shall come to the end of my days without knowing what was going on, I shall have to be content with accepting the not knowing as mystery and grace.

The detective who came to our house concluded that there was absolutely no evidence of any improper behavior, and in fact said that there was plenty of evidence of abundant love. What lessons am I to take away? 

- Overreach of government?
- Unintended consequences of "no tolerance" policies?
- The broad attraction of libelous stories?

## Bicycle

Several aspects of Emma's personality led me to think she would not be susceptible to propagandistic strategies. One is that she has demonstrated from the beginning a fierce determination at whatever she had her mind set on. When she was still an infant, if she had her mind on demonstrating her unhappiness, there was no quieting or comforting her. The only strategy was to wear her out.

An illustration of this behavior is immediate circumstances of her learning to ride a bicycle. She followed her big sister's bicycle, riding her tricycle and then a bicycle with training wheels, until the point she couldn't take it any more. She was going to learn to balance. One memorable day she did it. She got up on the bicycle and rode around and around the cul de sac. The only thing is that she didn't know how to stop. The only solution she could find was to run headlong into a large shrub at the neighbor's driveway. Down she went. But there was no doubting that she would get right back up and practice her braking.

I have photographs of the two sisters, buried deep in the leaves of racked from our yard. Two sides of our property were completely forested; so there were lots of leaves to gather off the lawn. The laughter and joy evident on the faces of those two girls has buoyed  me ever after. 

Another characteristic of Emma's arose only later when she was "double-digit" in Hawai'i. She learned about *Facebook* and took to it immediately. She was hooked on the social feedback she got. There were warning signs. She was the victim of cyber-bullying at *The Priory*. The perpetrator was given reprimands and punishments, but Emma would be susceptible to the persuasians of her audience. 

## Determination to swim
Emma's persistence would be demonstrated also in the process of learning to swim. Each of the daughters had been exposed to Lake Michigan from an early age. Lydia had a special love for the water, even when it was uncomfortable child. When it came to the drive across the country, culminating in our move to Honolulu, both girls were determined to learn to swim. I remember their brother Julian coaching them at a motel pool in Colorado Springs. But it was landing in Hawaii that the passion hit full throttle. There was a pool at the condominium we were staying in. It was desperately child, but each girl pushed the other to "swim". Initially that was swimming underwater the width of the pool. Then the length was attempted, but that ultimately meant figuring out how to come up for a breath. For the life of me they quickly looked like fish -- or mermaids -- in the water. We were just a short block from the beach at Waikiki; stop their time in those early days in Hawaii was split between pool and ocean. 
## In church
Emma's single-mindedness and independent steak was evident in one event that has remained for me through these many years as one my most precious memories. As children of the parish priest, they were comfortable moving around the various places in church. That would include the worship space (sanctuary) and the sacristy, as well as behind the scenes places. At the church of their youth there were two panels on either side of the altar space. These covered two doors going to rooms behind the sanctuary, and on one side the equalizer and amplifier for the PA system was shelved. 

Going back years to a previous church I was a member of, and involving my oldest child, Owen, I had become persuaded that the best place for young children was right up front in church, not shuttled behind windows and crying rooms. So my children were accustomed to be right in the midst of whatever was happening in church. So it wasn't surprising when one Sunday the whole congregation was suddenly jolted by a shreek (sp) coming from the PA system. Emma, age 3-4, was quickly discovered behind one of the panels and had turned knobs, including the volume knob, all the way on. That memory illustrates something of Emma's personality, but it is another memory that is so endearing to me.

One Sunday the bishop was coming for his annual visitation. Now on normal Sundays Emma had established her own tradition regarding the procession out at the end of the service. She was seated there in the front pew. She would watch the choir and other assistants go by. Then when her father (me) brought up the rear, she would step out into the aisle and walk out beside me. On this particular Sunday, it was the bishop who came last in the procession rather than her Daddy. So, as the bishop walked past her, she very ceremoniously stepped out behind and it was Emma that day who

The insight that Lydia and Emma were each of them envious for what the other had.
	  
Calling "911" from "Mama Sue's"
	  
There was some ambivalence about whether the *Priory* was the right school for Emma. It clearly was for her sister. Did she vacillate about going? I can't remember. Perhaps she wanted to follow in her sister's path. Perhaps she wanted to blaze her own trail. But I knew that her needs were very different from Lydia's.
## Life is fleeting

I Associate with her the movie *Rent* and the lyrics.
