## Journal Entries
- [ ]  Watched the movie *Herself.* [Review](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/herself/reviews?intcmp=rt-what-to-know_read-critics-reviews) 
> A quietly eloquent little film about the hurt of ending an abusive relationship, the hardship of asking others for help, and the healing power of starting a new life on your own terms.(*Leigh Paatsch* **Herald Sun** *Australia*))

I so identified with the film tonight. My sense of it is that i endured Bridget in a way similar to the way Sandra endured her abusive husband who eventually beat her and wrecked her hand. I recognize that the gender reversal is not recognized by very many people--
I am so deeply supportive of the liberation, the emancipation come on over women. Bridget didn't acknowledge that and Lydia and Emma don't recognize it.It's reflected in my abhorrence of **Justice Amy**, and my resistance, and now repulsion of **The people of praise** kinds of ideology. cf. recent published reports on the patriarchy and submission of women in **The People of Praise** -- Kevin Ranaghan and his wife (I think I never actually met them, but read him and traveled in those circles.) [cf. *The Guardian* report ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/26/amy-coney-barrett-faith-group-people-of-praise) cf. the questions put to Bp. Frey and his rebuttal to my concerns. I think my reaction to the priest at *Holy Trinity* is related to that.
