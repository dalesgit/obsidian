- Yesterday looking for the extraordinary in the ordinary. 
	1. Walking the neighborhood to hand out loaves of bread that MP had made. The 2<sup>nd</sup> stop had a young man outside in the frigid air. Maybe he had been smoking. Maybe just drinking coffee. I asked if it was OK to leave the bread with him. As he responded with his "yes" he said something about the hospital. He saw that I was a neighbor and assumed that I knew about whoever was in the hospital. I didn't. I said, "Tell me about the hospital." 
	   He went on to talk about his father having had an implanted de-fibrillator or pacemaker? and something went wrong. He was returned to the hospital in ICU but now he was preparing to come home.
	   I touched a life and he felt heard. I was blessed.
	2. The exquisite rendition of the the "Night of silence" / "Silent night" overlay at church.
