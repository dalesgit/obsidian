	  What a development! I learned today that I had been removed from one of the courses that I had been planning to teach: Introduction to Reading Biblical Texts. No warning. I discovered it while preparing my syllabus. Immediately I knew that I could not teach my other course. I was done with Winthrop. Mary Pat  made the connection that my tenure with WU began bureaucratic bull shit and it was ending with the same. Kristin Kiblinger didn't respond to my obvious offense but rather to a defensive nonsense about why it happened.
	  
	  There is real relief at having WU suddenly lifted from my burdens. I have to navigate telling Greg and returning the key. But I'm done with that and so my life is simpler.
	  
	  Somewhat impoverished but I'll have to work at the intellectual stimulation part.
