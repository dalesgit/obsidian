In “Demon Copperhead,” Barbara Kingsolver reimagines “David Copperfield” as a tale set in Southern Appalachia, and brings humanity and humor to a region and people who have long endured exploitation and condescension.

Oct. 14, 2022

MEADOWVIEW, VA. — Most of Barbara Kingsolver’s novels begin with a question, usually involving an injustice: how to tell a story about America’s exploitation of developing countries, for example, or the effects of climate change on rural communities.

Her latest book began with the question of how to tell a story about the opioid epidemic that is ravaging Appalachia.

The answer came, she said, from a visitation by Charles Dickens. (More on that later. “I don’t usually talk to dead people,” she said.) The result of the conversation, her 17th novel in nearly three decades as a best-selling author, is “Demon Copperhead,” out on Oct. 18, which reimagines the hero of “David Copperfield” as a young man in contemporary Southern Appalachia.

Kingsolver is a child of the region, and a biologist with an intimate knowledge of and love for its unique ecosystem — its flora and its fauna, including the human kind. She is fiercely protective of its communities and irritated by the prejudice heaped on it. She had choice words for J.D. Vance, now running for the U.S. Senate from Ohio. His 2016 best seller, “Hillbilly Elegy,” was a bootstrapping memoir wrapped in a polemic Kingsolver found especially condescending.

In her book, Kingsolver slyly weaves the history of her home into Demon’s harrowing tale. From the Whiskey Rebellion to the boom and bust of the tobacco and coal industries, she describes a community preyed on for decades as governments and companies extracted their resources. And then came the opioid crisis. Everyone knows someone who has lost a friend to overdose, she said, or children who are being raised by someone other than their parents.

“We’re left with a generation of kids who’ve had their lives torn apart,” she said. “I wanted to say, ‘Look, it’s still here, and this got done to us and we didn’t deserve it.’”

Kingsolver was raised in a rural town in Kentucky; her father was the local doctor, often paid in baked goods or labor, and the first member of his family to go to college. Like her father, she was a bit of an oddball in a community where, as she described it, the goal was survival. In high school, Kingsolver took a correspondence course in philosophy, read Hume, Kant and Tolstoy when her peers were making out in cars, and won a piano scholarship to DePauw University in Indiana. She switched to biology because, as she said, it seemed more sensible; she didn’t want to end up playing “The Shadow of Your Smile” in hotel lobbies.

“I come from practical people,” she said.

These days, Kingsolver, now 67, lives in a century-old farmhouse nestled in a hollow in the picturesque town of Meadowview, Va., right over the border from Tennessee, with a population just shy of 1,000. It’s more than 200 miles from where she grew up, but it’s still Appalachia. The region stretches from New York to northern Mississippi, but its cultural identity, as Kingsolver pointed out, is most identified with a handful of states.

On a mild September afternoon, we sat in rocking chairs on her porch, the vibrant landscape spread out before us like a psychedelic terrarium. Southern Appalachian hollows, as these temperate canyons are called, make up one of the most biodiverse environments in the United States. Hummingbirds zipped in and out of a purple buddleia bush; Hugo, an eager-to-please Border collie, stretched out on the porch, smelling faintly of skunk. A rooster squawked, and in the distance you could hear Kingsolver’s flock of Icelandic sheep mumbling whatever it is that sheep need to tell each other.

Kingsolver and her second husband, Steven Hopp, moved here with their two daughters full-time 18 years ago. Hopp had bought the place years earlier, when he began teaching at Emory & Henry College, a small liberal arts institution a few miles away. He told me that his wife fell in love with his land — they met after he invited her to speak to one of his classes — and he came with the deal. Since generations of Kingsolvers also settled in this county, it’s as much a home to her as Kentucky was.

But back to Dickens. Kingsolver was touring in England for her 2018 book, “Unsheltered,” when she discovered that Bleak House, where Dickens wrote much of “David Copperfield,” was a bed-and-breakfast. Who could resist? She and Hopp were the only guests at the cliffside mansion. Kingsolver settled into the study where Dickens had worked, while Hopp went to bed.

“I sat at his desk and I just started communing with Dickens,” she said. “I thought about how ‘David Copperfield’ was his own story, and I’m thinking we’re in the same boat. I’m sure the polite Victorians did not want to hear about poorhouses and orphanages and yet they were waiting each month for the next installment.”

She went on: “I asked him, ‘How do I do that?’ And he said: ‘Let the kid tell the story. No one doubts the child.’ It was really late, I got the willies and I went back to the room where Steven was sleeping and said, ‘Hey, I just had this amazing conversation with Charles Dickens,’ and he said, ‘Did it end well?’”

It ended very well. Kingsolver spent the rest of the night writing. She saw her hero, a redheaded boy with green eyes whose nickname would be Copperhead (“Demon” came later, an inevitable schoolyard moniker since his given name was Damon). As with David Copperfield, the story of his life begins with his birth, in his case in a trailer to a hapless, precariously sober teenage mother. “Born *in* the mobile home,” Demon says later. “That’s like the Eagle Scout of trailer trash.”

Kingsolver puts Demon through hell — the degradations of foster care, as he is taken in by a series of struggling families and one brutish farmer; and the stark realities of being a foster kid, always hungry, often dirty, trying to be invisible. Kingsolver said she knew firsthand Demon’s emotional landscape, particularly the humiliations of being a teenage outlander and the cruelty of your peers.

She was bullied for wearing hand-me down clothes, she said, and for her own peculiar interests, though she found solace in them, escaping into books and music and nature, writing stories and playing in the woods with her two siblings. After graduating from DePauw, she earned a master’s degree in biology (and nearly a Ph.D.) at the University of Arizona. She was studying the social behavior of termites for her thesis. When she finished the paper, she said, she counted the people with the capacity to read it. “I came up with 11, and I thought, you know, maybe I could do better.”

Kingsolver began writing fiction to deal with the insomnia that plagued her when she was in Tucson, working as a journalist, married to her first husband and expecting her first child, Camille. And she picked her agent, [Frances Goldin](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/frances-goldin-dead.html), out of a writer’s directory because her entry read, as Kingsolver recalled, “I do not represent any work that is sexist, racist, ageist, homophobic or gratuitously violent.”

Goldin loved her first book, about women holding a picket line through a copper mine strike. It failed to sell, but Kingsolver wrote her a thank-you note for trying. Goldin framed it, and told the story for decades: “Who thanks an agent for not selling her book?” To which Kingsolver will say, “It’s how I was raised.”

When Kingsolver sent Goldin “The Bean Trees,” about a bright young Kentucky woman who flees her rural community for a better life in Arizona, she apologized for wasting her time again, saying she wasn’t even sure it was a novel. Goldin called to say that yes, it was a novel, and a very good one. She sold it the next day, while Kingsolver was in the hospital having Camille.

“The Bean Trees” received critical acclaim when it was published in 1988. The strike story, “Holding the Line,” sold a year later. In 1993, Kingsolver was divorced and barely scraping by when her third book, “Pigs in Heaven,” which picks up where “The Bean Trees” left off, became a best seller and made Kingsolver, at last, financially solvent. And a celebrity author.

The advance for “The Poisonwood Bible,” out in 1998, was reported to be a million dollars; with it, Kingsolver established a biannual $25,000 literary prize for first-time novelists whose work tackled social change. Devoted readers send her gifts — a can-jo “banjo” made from a can of Mountain Dew; handmade sweaters and quilts; a scythe as tall as the author; and various charms and blessings along with entreaties that she live forever.

She fills auditoriums during her book tours, and appears at events with other environmentalists, like Al Gore. Kingsolver is often a “Jeopardy!” clue. Former President Barack Obama counts her among his favorite authors and has solicited writing advice from her.

“She means to save us by telling us stories,” said the novelist Ann Patchett. “She comes closer than anyone else I know. She’s able to tell us things we desperately need to know in a way that makes it possible for us to hear it.”

In “Demon Copperhead,” opioid addiction destroys Demon’s mother, then ensnares him, too. To understand an addict’s experience, Kingsolver contacted Art Van Zee, the Virginia physician who sounded an early alarm about the dangers of OxyContin and now treats recovering addicts. Van Zee connected her with his patients, whose stories find their way into Demon’s. They taught Kingsolver what it feels it like to be dopesick, detailed the mechanics of the drug — how to shoot it up or inhale its vapor — and shared the heartbreaking economics, from pill mills to trap houses and prostitution.

“Every single one of these informants started with a legal prescription following doctor’s orders,” said Kingsolver.

Their stories broke her heart.

Demon’s descent into addiction took Kingsolver to a dark place. “If you’re not emotionally engaged with your characters, it’s not going to work on the page,” she said.

“You’re doing this for a good purpose,” her husband reminded her. “Come back to the surface so you can go back down to hell tomorrow.”

Richard Powers, an early reader of “Demon Copperhead” and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “The Overstory,” called Demon’s narration “one of the great virtuosic vocal performances.”

“This guy’s voice is just pouring out,” he said. “It was a master class in how to make sentences just soar and how to make a character lift off.”

Kingsolver gives Dickens a cameo in the novel: He’s required reading in one of Demon’s English classes. Books are mostly a time suck, Demon declares, but some authors held his interest. “Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Jesus Christ did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over.”

He concluded, “You’d think he was from around here.”
