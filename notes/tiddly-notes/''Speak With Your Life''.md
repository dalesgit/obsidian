Reflection
*Give Us This Day*

**Speak With Your Life**

Proclaim the Gospel to every creature.

You and I have a unique purpose and call. We have a unique expression of what our relationship with Jesus looks like in prayer. Each of us has a specific expression of what service to God looks like. Here are words that I savor over and over again about the small-s saints (you and me) since they were published by Pope Francis in Gaudete et Exsultate: “Each saint is a mission, planned by the Father to reflect and embody, at a specific moment in history, a certain aspect of the Gospel” (11). Holy wow! Read that one a few times! Each of us is created in such a way that we are being invited to reflect a certain part of the Good News at a specific moment in history. Look around you: think of people you know who are sharing the Good News in all kinds of ways. . . .

If we pay attention, we will notice how frequently we encounter people who are expressing aspects of the gospel at a specific moment in history. Pope Francis invites us in Gaudete et Exsultate to see the entirety of our life as mission. His blessing to us is “May you come to realize what the word is, the message of Jesus that God wants to speak to the world by your life” (cf. 23–24).

Your unique call is the word that Jesus invites you to speak to the world by your life and calling. It plays out in every relationship you are in, every encounter you have, how you use your gifts, and what you do with your time. The same is true for every other person. This is how we are Jesus’ co-laborers in the vineyard. This is how we are his cocreators in building the kingdom of God.
