On the seventh day of the American creation, God and the Devil felt weary. Then Pablo Neruda spoke and baptized all things in our magnificent and horrible continent.

A patriarch of storms, he belied them with the slow majesty of his movements. The ironic intelligence of the fallen angel lurked behind his sleepy, turtle‐like eyelids. He looked like a timeless animal. He could be as vast and anonymous as the ocean. He could be as strait and sharp as the land of grape and mud and copper and peach and nitrate and tremors ensheathed between the Andes and the Pacific. A Chilean poet, the son of workers, raised in a province forgotten by all save by rain and hunger, the sea sent him drunken boat, the forests poured down on him their leaves of grass. A teen‐age poet, flanked by Rimbaud and Whitman, at 20 he had revolutionized the poetry written in the Spanish language.

From the damp solitude of the valley of Temuco, then from the streets of Santiago and the docks of Valparaiso, always from the end of the world, Robinson on the Chilean islands of his birth and his death, Neruda, without having read them, was writing with Eliot and St. John Perse, with Eluard and Cummings. And, with them, he was transforming the face of the verb. But if they could proceed from the center of a civilization, Neruda had to scream and sob and whisper from the soundless frontiers of an eccentric culture.

Chile was called The New Extreme by the conquistadores. From that polar limit of the earth, Pablo Neruda sent the ships of Columbus back to Spain. He was the first great poet of the Spanish language since the 17th century. He was the first writer to rediscover the lost voices of Quevedo and Góngora. He was the cultural answer of Spanish America to the Spanish Conquest. He gave back our

The Guest Word speech to a Spain numbed by 300 years of inquisition, rhetoric, fear, mediocrity and good manners.

Without his poetic adventure, there would be no modern literature in Latin America. His enormous scope was due to the fact that he dared take on the risks of impurity, imperfection, and, yes, banality. He had to do it, in order to name a world. Our world. He led us all to the savage zones of our forgotten language. He freed us from the norms of exquisite form and barren good taste. He taught us to eat and drink. He made us look inside barbershops and tremble before our ghosts on the windows of shoe stores. He drove us out of the sterile gardens of our literary Versailles and plunged us into the mire Of city gutters and the putrefaction of tropical forests. He showed us our nakedness on golden deserts and our height on volcanic peaks. He gave a voice to both the living and the dead, to the lovers in the twilight of a suburban apartment and to the stone and sand of Indian prince's citadel.

All of Spanish America was resurrected in his tongue. His poetry permitted us to recuperate four centuries of lost history, a history masked by hollow speeches and grandiose proclamations, mutilated by external imperialism and internal oppression, disfigured by the offended silence of the many and the offensive lie of the few.

We did not always see eye to eye on political issues. But if his quarrels with the men of his generation were bitter, with us, the younger writers, he was always generous, open, intelligent, capable of dialogue, reason and dissent. For what united us was far greater than what separated us. Our novels were written under the sign of Neruda to give the inert past a living present, to lend an actual voice to the silence of history. This genesic root was far more important than our discrepancies on what the form of the future should be like—for if we did not save our past and make it live in the present, we would have no future at all.

At this Memorial of my friend, this original community is the value I wish to evoke and sustain. Neruda's wake took place in a ravaged house, his house with the late winter winds blowing through shattered window panes and stirring the ashes of his burnt books. A plundered house, a nation raped: Neruda and democratic socialism in Chile died at the same time. This terrible coincidence of two agonies makes me recall something Neruda once said to me: “We, the Latin American writers, would like te fly. But our wings are heavy with the blood of our peoples.”

The free people Neruda gave so much of his life and work for are today being murdered by a gang of reactionary officers and fascist hoodlums.

A head of state who killed no one has been killed, perhaps because he respected life too Much. The nascent alliance of independent states in Latin America has disintegrated. The coexistence and ideological plurality proposed by the governments of Mexico, Chile, Cuba and Peru has suffered a sad defeat. The sub‐imperialist model of Brazil prepares to impose itself: booming cities, huge foreign investments, and, behind this fake facade of prosperity, stagnation in the hinterland, perpetuation of colonial structures, development with torture, the repression of dissidence, a progress riddled with debt and bereft of autonomy, internal order at the expense of civil freedoms and national sovereignty.

Our future looms tragic and one is tempted to repeat the parting words of the Liberator Bolivar: “We “have plowed the seas.” Chile has been made safe for supermarkets. Chile has been made safe for I.T.T. Is this our destiny as part of the secure and immediate sphere of influence of one of the superpowers? Is the fortress of détente to be built on the graves of democratic socialism in Chile and Czechoslovakia? Is the price of détente the exploitation of the resources, the submission of the wills and the assassination of the hopes of the weaker nations? If so, then détente is not peace, and peace will have to be won, against frightful odds, by the victims of superpower condominium. We refuse to play the role of the slave on the stage of a neo‐Metternichian balance‐of‐power play.

We bear the grief of a poet and his people. But a poet is not his body, or his political. position, or his personal opinions. A poet is a totality of language. And the language of “Canto General,” “Residencia en la tierra,”‐ “Odas elementales” and “Viente poemas de amor” has not died. It even knows the glory of anonymity, for Neruda's poems are sung with defiance and shouted with rage and murmured with love by millions of Latin Americans who, sometimes, do not even know the name of the poet who wrote those words. An unsigned poetry. Like a temple. Like a mountain.

Things do not belong to all. But words do. Words are the first and most natural instance of a common property. Writing, whether the writer wills it or not, is always a communion and a community. Pablo Neruda is only the owner of the words he wrote because he is not Pablo Neruda: he is all men; he is the poet. The poet is born after his act: the poem. The poem creates its author, much as it creates its reader. And so, on his death, Neruda's poetry returns as a promise of freedom to his muzzled and shackled people, his poetry once again becomes sea and desert, mountain and rain, his poetry is again, as in the beginning, named Temuco, Atacama, Bio Bio.

The poetry will survive. The people will survive. Sixty years ago, in Mexico, another President who respected life and justice, another Allende named Madero was murdered by another Pinochet called Huerta. The military took power and claimed to have the situation under control. But then, from the shadows of history, surged the men without names: Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa....

Temuco, Atacama, Bio Bio. From the names of Pablo Neruda's poetry will also rise the men of the Chilean revolution. Because he gave us a past and a present, Pablo Neruda will be with us in the perilous conquest of our future. ■
