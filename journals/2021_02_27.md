	  Worked on:
	  
	  1. getting 3 devices linked with **syncthing**
	  1. getting liturgy-template corrected in place with 3 devices
	  1. Advancing the presentations status with 317 – I'm pretty good up through early 20th c. module. Need to get notes done on 3-4 modules.
	  1. gathered Easter music Easter liturgy
	  
	  On my walk I listened to talk on Montaigne. Esp. the essay teaching left me thinking that my effort at writing a huge work on Church and Tyranny at least convinced me that I could write **essays**. Perhaps work on the next one on early earlychurch&pacifism?
	  
	  Discussion about whether:
	  
	  1. to make variation in the format of daily prayer
	  1. Lenten reading as we did with 3 volumes early on: Imprisoned text, David … re. Celtic, and Madeline L'Engle on church year?
