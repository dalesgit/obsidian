### Psalm 14

*Dixit insipiens*

1 The fool has said in his heart, "There is no **God**." *  
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;  
there is none who does any **good**.

2 The Lord looks down from heaven upon us **all**, *  
to see if there is any who is wise,  
if there is one who seeks after **God**.

3 Every one has proved faithless;  
all alike have turned **bad**; *  
there is none who does good; no, not **one**.

4 Have they no knowledge, all those evil**doers** *  
who eat up my people like bread  
and do not call upon the **Lord**?

5 See how they tremble with **fear**, *  
because God is in the company of the **righteous**.

6 Their aim is to confound the plans of the af**flicted**, *  
but the Lord is their **refuge**.

7 Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *  
when the Lord restores the fortunes of his people,  
Jacob will rejoice and Israel be **glad**.
