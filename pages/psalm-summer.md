# Fifth Sunday after the Epiphany
### Psalm 147:1-12, 21c

*Laudate Dominum*

1 Hallelujah!  
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *  
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!

2 The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem; *  
he gathers the exiles of Israel.

3 He heals the brokenhearted *  
and binds up their wounds.

4 He counts the number of the stars *  
and calls them all by their names.

5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power; *  
there is no limit to his wisdom.

6 The Lord lifts up the lowly, *  
but casts the wicked to the ground.

7 Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; *  
make music to our God upon the harp.

8 He covers the heavens with clouds *  
and prepares rain for the earth;

9 He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *  
and green plants to serve mankind.

10 He provides food for flocks and herds *  
and for the young ravens when they cry.

11 He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *  
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;

12 But the Lord has pleasure in those who fear him, *  
in those who await his gracious favor.

21 Hallelujah!
