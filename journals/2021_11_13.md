	- Dear Emma,
	  
	  Would that there were words. Enough of them. The select right ones for the job. The job to reflect the loss of what never was. Of dreams? Perhaps. The last birthday gift I remember giving you was a kite ride above Honolulu waters. I don't know if you ever cashed it in. So many years now, I guess it doesn't matter. If there's a dream, now, I suppose it is that before I die you might walk into my room. So much gone.
	  
	  Hau'oli la hanau. Shalom, my beautiful girl. So bright and full of life.
	  
	  Dad
