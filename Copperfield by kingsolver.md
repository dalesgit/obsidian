**DEMON COPPERHEAD,** by Barbara Kingsolver

---

In “Demon Copperhead,” Barbara Kingsolver offers a close retelling of Charles Dickens’s “David Copperfield,” which is either a baffling choice or an ingenious maneuver from a novelist who has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and selected for Oprah’s Book Club and regularly — inevitably, even — appears on the best-seller list of this newspaper, all while reaping a surprising quantity of stinging pans from critics.

Kingsolver’s resurrection of Dickens’s most sentimental (though cherished by many, including me) novel might seem a bit strange — as if Harry Styles had released a song-for-song remake of the original cast recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “South Pacific.”

But then, from another angle: Of course Barbara Kingsolver would retell Dickens. He has always been her ancestor. Like Dickens, she is unblushingly political and works on a sprawling scale, animating her pages with the presence of seemingly every creeping thing that has ever crept upon the earth. Exhuming him is a way for her to make a claim of inheritance explicit at a time when teeming, boisterous, activist novels are unfashionable. It is an argument that this loss of prestige is unwarranted, impermanent, even benighted, and it is a rebuttal of the notion that ideologues can’t make great novelists, or that novels are no longer plausible vehicles for social change.

Before we consider those questions: the plot. Damon Fields is born in southwest Virginia in the late 1980s to a teenage mother who has equipped herself for childbirth with gin, amphetamines and Vicodin. An attitude problem soon earns him the nickname “Demon.” His hair color explains “Copperhead.” When Mom overdoses Demon becomes a ward of the state, which is to say he undergoes a transformation from “boy” to “inventory.” He’s obsessed with Marvel superheroes and draws his own comics. In fifth grade he accidentally works at a meth lab.

High school football delivers a brief spell of glory. Then: knee injury, doctor-prescribed painkillers, opioid addiction, young love and a relentless chain of tragedies interrupted sporadically with minor victories. Although it is technically legal to spoil the ending of a story devised 173 years ago, I won’t, except to note that Kingsolver’s resolution departs in one major way from that of “David Copperfield,” which is almost universally regarded as a disappointment.

Like Dickens, Kingsolver generates momentum by galloping the reader through escapades that accumulate to advance a larger question — in this case, about how an artist’s consciousness is formed. The intellectual and spiritual quest at the heart of both novels meets resistance in the form of capital-I issues. For Kingsolver, these include poverty and rural dispossession, as well as the shortcomings of American public education, health care and child-welfare agencies. But her primary target is Purdue Pharma, the Sackler-owned company that contributed heavily to the opioid crisis with its aggressive (and spectacularly lucrative) push of OxyContin.

Anyone who has required medical care in the United States knows the torture of the indefinite wait: that specific circle of hell in which a patient languishes without a clue about when, how or if he’ll be treated, or how much it will cost, or what variety of malpractice may result. Demon’s addiction story is drearily credible. After getting injured on the field, he requires X-rays and an M.R.I. There is a three-week wait for appointments. The Lortab prescription is meant as a stopgap. But one thing leads to another. …

Addiction itself is not a passive condition. It takes no small effort to get money and procure a substance and administer the substance and maintain whatever choreography of concealment the habit demands in order to prolong itself. Demon’s drug-seeking exertions are rare moments of willfulness in an otherwise passive existence. He is shoved into football by a coach, coaxed into pain pills by a doctor, lured into fentanyl by a girlfriend and tricked into abetting a robbery by a friend. Opioid oblivion is merely the logical and depressing apotheosis of his constitution. If Demon is essentially passive, then he is most himself when unconscious.

This is the conundrum of the book. Dickens’s novel opens with the narrator’s famous salvo of self-determination: “Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.” Kingsolver’s version is tellingly different: “Save or be saved, these are questions,” Copperhead says. “You want to think it’s not over till the last page.” One bespeaks volition, the other fatalism.

In a novel ostensibly about self-creation, Demon’s addiction is a narrative impasse. He can’t conquer it until he summons the will to change; he can’t summon the will to change because he’s a severely impaired addict. Someone will have to come to his rescue.

These are premise problems, not sentence problems. Kingsolver’s prose is often splendid. There is the “dog-breath air of late summer,” the guy with “wrongful” eyebrows, the man who makes his way down a staircase “like something dumped out of a bucket.” Episode by episode she persuasively conveys the mind of a teenage boy. Here is Demon getting so famished he eats a candy bar after it has gone through the wash; here is Demon obsessively seeking a location where he and his girlfriend can have sex in private. (A reminder that one of the chief privileges of adulthood, albeit a rapidly diminishing one, is the ability to make oneself unsurveillable.) Credit where due: It’s hard to think of another living novelist who could take a stab at Dickens and rise above the level of catastrophe.

“David Copperfield” is ultimately the story of a nobody who grows up and becomes a somebody — specifically, a writer. It’s important to note that the trajectory from destitute orphan to famous author was dramatically steeper in 1850, when Charles Dickens could plausibly be called the most famous person in his nation, than in the 2000s, when a list of the top 20 most famous Americans would include zero writers. For a novel to be a vehicle of social change, it must first capture the public imagination — a thing that can no longer be said to exist. If Demon were to replicate the social ascent of David — if Kingsolver had followed the spirit and not the letter of the original — he’d have to grow up and become, say, a reality TV star who wins the presidency.

And so, caught between polemic and fairy tale, Kingsolver is stuck with an anticlimax. Demon blossoms into an authentic artist and reaps all the rewards associated with that calling in modern-day America: obscurity, instability, compensation best measured in units of peanut. Oddly enough, it is meant to pass for a happy ending. He may be poor, injured, orphaned, landless and haunted by dead friends — but what’s all that next to the pleasures of self-expression? Here, finally, is where optimism — of character and author alike — takes on the quality of delusion.
