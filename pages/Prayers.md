[[Wesley prayer]] 
## Benedictus Dominic

Praise the Lord, the **God** of Israel,  
who shepherds the people  
and **sets** them free.

God raises from David's house  
a child with **power** to save.  
Through the holy prophets  
God promised in **ages** past  
to save us from en**emy** hands,  
from the grip of **all** who hate us.

The Lord favored our ancestors  
recalling the **sacred** covenant,  
the pledge to our an**cestor** Abraham,  
to free us **from** our enemies,  
so we might worship without fear  
and be holy and just **all** our days.  

And you, child, will be called  
Prophet of **the** Most High,  
for you will come to prepare  
a pathway **for** the Lord  
by teaching the peo**ple** salvation  
through forgiveness **of** their sin.  

Out of God's **deepest** mercy  
a dawn will come **from** on high,  
light for those shad**owed** by death,  
a guide for our feet on the  **way** to peace.

Glory to the Father, and **to** the Son,  
and to the **Hol**y Spirit,
as it was in **the** beginning, is now,  
and will be for ev**er**. Amen


## New Zealand Lord's Prayer
Eternal Spirit,  
Earth-maker, Pain-bearer, Life-giver,  
Source of all that is and that shall be,  
Father and Mother of us all,  
Loving God, in whom is heaven:

The hallowing of your name echo through the universe!  
The way of your justice be followed by the peoples of the world!  
Your heavenly will be done by all created beings  
Your commonwealth of peace and freedom  
sustain our hope and come on earth.

With the bread we need for today, feed us.  
In the hurts we absorb from one another, forgive us.  
In times of temptation and test, strengthen us.  
From trials too great to endure, spare us.  
From the grip of all that is evil, free us.

For you reign in the glory of the power that is love,  
now and for ever. Amen.

## Parker Palmer Lord's Prayer

[Source](https://godspacelight.com/2020/04/04/unpacking-the-lords-prayer-with-parker-palmer/)

> Today’s version of The Lord’s Prayer is by one of my favourite authors. Parker Palmer has inspired me through so much of his writing and this I find inspirational too. Discovered from prayer service at Ring Lake Ranch.

Heavenly Father, heavenly Mother,  
Holy and blessed is your true name.  
We pray for your reign of peace to come,  
We pray that your good will be done,  
Let heaven and earth become one.  
Give us this day the bread we need,  
Give it to those who have none.

Let forgiveness flow like a river between us,  
From each one to each one.  
Lead us to holy innocence  
Beyond the evil of our days —  
Come swiftly Mother, Father, come.  

For yours is the power and the glory and the mercy:  
Forever your name is All in One.

## New Serenity Prayer

[Jesuits](https://thejesuitpost.org/2012/11/a-new-serenity-prayer/## New Serenity Prayer)

God, grant me the serenity
to accept the people I cannot change,
which is pretty much everyone,
since I’m clearly not you, God.
At least not the last time I checked.

And while you’re at it, God,
please give me the courage
to change what I need to change about myself,
which is frankly a lot, since, once again,
I’m not you, which means I’m not perfect.
It’s better for me to focus on changing myself
than to worry about changing other people,
who, as you’ll no doubt remember me saying,
I can’t change anyway.

Finally, give me the wisdom to just shut up
whenever I think that I’m clearly smarter
than everyone else in the room,
that no one knows what they’re talking about except me,
or that I alone have all the answers.

Basically, God,
grant me the wisdom
to remember that I’m
not you.

Amen





## Venite

Come, sing with **joy** to God,  
shout to our sav**ior**, our rock.  
Enter God's pre**sence** with praise,  
enter with shout**ing** and song.  
  
A great God is the Lord,  
over the gods **like** a king.  
God cradles the depths of the earth,  
holds fast the **moun**tain peaks.  
God shaped the o**cean** and owns it,  
formed the **earth** by hand.

Come, bow **down** and worship,  
kneel to the **Lord** our maker  
This is our **God**, our shepherd,  
we are the flock **led** with care.  
  
Listen today **to** God's voice  
"Harden no heart as at Meribah,  
on that day in the de**sert** at Massah.  
There your **peo**ple tried me,  
though they had **seen** my work.  
  
"Forty years **with** that lot  
I said: They are perverse,  
they do not ac**cept** my ways  
So I swore **in** my anger  
They shall not en**ter** my rest."

O **gra**cious light,  
pure brightness of the everliving Fa**ther** in heaven,  
O Jesus Christ, hol**y** and blessed!  

Now as we come to the setting **of** the sun,  
and our eyes behold the **ves**per light,  
we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and **Ho**ly Spirit.  

You are worthy at all times to be praised by **hap**py voices,  
O Son of God, O Giv**er** of Life,  
and to be glorified through **all** the worlds.

## Magnificat

*Chant*

I acclaim the greatness **of** the Lord,  
I delight in **God** my savior,  
who regarded my **hum**ble state  
Truly from this day on  
all ages will **call** me blest.


For God, wonder**ful** in power,  
has used that **strength** for me.  
Holy the name **of** the Lord!  
whose mercy embraces the faithful,  
one generation **to** the next.

The mighty arm of God  
scatters the proud in **their** conceit,  
pulls tyrants from their thrones,  
and raises **up** the humble.  
The Lord **fills** the starving  
and lets the **rich** go hungry  .

God rescues **lowly** Israel,  
recalling the prom**ise** of mercy,  
the promise made **to** our ancestors,  
to Abraham's **heirs** for ever
