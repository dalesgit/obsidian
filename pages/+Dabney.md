- I'm extremely fortunate to be in the area where St. John's Tampa was where his father was rector.
- Lots of retired clergy but lots of variation in what they expect, want.
- Stephen Gerth in Naples
- great rector (troubled past) who 2 rectors ended up being deposed. Went to the Church on Easter Sunday to tell them. Then a few years later on the 1st Sunday after Easter. Recovering mode with mission mindedness. Dunedin priest doing well. Some others Holy Trinity
