	- ## Lydia called!
	  
	  I had just got back from a **very productive** morning. I finished 2 sermons. Cleaned out the study for Amy. Went to the dump, Goodwill, and cleaned off the pollen from the car. Made the copies of Sunday's bulletin.
	  
	  She called to say thank you for the Easter Card. I learned that Nick has the children we see – they get them every other weekend. He had a "tire warehouse" job for 12 years, had a conflict, and has returned now for a couple of years. Starting in May she is going to begin work to get an MA and a teaching certificate from an online institution. They have a hub in No. IN, but are based in Kalamazoo. She needs it to keep her job – she's an emergency hire at an elementary school. She will be traveling to west coast to meet up with Emma and will drive back to Indiana.
	  
	  She talked of years long plans with Nick, upgrading their house etc. It is located just down from St. Michael's. Currently they are remodeling. House has 2 bedrooms, but a loft that is livable and a basement that can be made to be so.
	  
	  She said that Nick helps her to feel good about herself. And that that's welcome. **Ah~\ I\ have\ known\ that\ so\ well\ for\ the\ past\ 15\ years\ at\ least,\ or\ more.**
