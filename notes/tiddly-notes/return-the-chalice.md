# Return-the-chalice

Eucharistic theology

* first re. 2-kinds was hospital communion
* Elijah cup
* AA wedding at St. James re. wine
* Eucharist at Kailua: poi and coconut milk
* communion at CPE
* these are not normal times â€“ for the time
* to do it for now, but in hope and expectation
* not doing it because of policy, but in an attempt to be faithful
* contagion from AIDS? if caught from cup then the clergy would have been decimated
