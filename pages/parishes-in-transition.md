## **‘What Are We Going to Lose?’**
​
While Catholicism does not have independent local congregations like some branches of Protestantism, Dr. Hoover noted that Catholics sometimes subscribe to the concept of de facto congregationalism, the idea that one’s parish is their congregation.
​
Among the concerns noted by parishioners at St. Mary’s, the overarching one was that of identity. St. Mary’s allows only male altar servers, and Mass attendees often dress more formally than those at Masses in other Catholic churches in New Haven. Walking into a service, one will often see young families with several young children kneeling in the pews, and sometimes a woman will wear a veil.
​
“It’s your particular faith community,” Dr. Hoover said. “It belongs to you.” As a result, some parishes have a particular character associated with them—a character that, when new leadership arrives, may appear to be endangered.
​
“What are we going to lose?” Ms. Woods asked. “We’re really losing a lot of our identity by losing the Dominicans, and as good as the new pastors may be, they’re not Dominicans, and it’s going to be hard for us to no longer be a Dominican parish.”
​
But both Father Lerner and Father Federico emphasized that the heart of the parish identity is something they will strive very hard to keep.
​
“Nothing dramatic is going to change, and certainly not the core identity of this place as a place where liturgy is exquisitely done, and solid orthodox Catholic preaching is expected, a place where young families are welcomed and celebrated,” Father Federico said. “All of that is going to stay the same.”
​
While smaller details of parish life—a Mass time, for example—may change, Father Lerner emphasized that the core of the community will remain true to the spirit of the community.
​
He added that his own faith journey was accompanied by the Dominicans—he attended the Dominican-affiliated Providence College in Rhode Island for his undergraduate degree and studied later at Albertus Magnus College, which was founded by the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs (now the Dominican Sisters of Peace) and located in New Haven. During his time at the latter, he said, he often prayed at the nearby St. Mary’s.
​
Father Lerner said much the same in the Dec. 5, 2021, bulletin for St. Mary’s, acknowledging the now-former pastor Father Walker’s work at the church and noting his own relationship with St. Mary’s, where he prayed while in seminary. While smaller details of parish life—a Mass time, for example—may change, Father Lerner emphasized that the core of the community will remain true to the spirit of the community.
​
“In that spirit, I want to assure you that I have no hidden agenda,” Father Lerner wrote in the bulletin. “This will continue to be a place where God is worshiped with the utmost reverence and joy, where the truth is preached in love, the Gospel is proclaimed unapologetically, and individuals and families, both in the pews and \[among\] those who are searching, journey ever closer to Christ together.”
​
## **Looking Back—and Forward**
​
Months later, in the spring of 2022, the faint aroma of incense hangs in the air. Ms. Woods said that while parish life is not exactly the same without the Dominicans, she appreciates the hard work that goes into being a parish priest and pointed out multiple times the vast number of responsibilities split between Father Lerner and Father Federico. “I don’t know how they’re still alive with the amount that they have to do,” she said.
​
Sara Hunter, another St. Mary’s parishioner, echoed Ms. Woods, saying that she understands that the priests are doing the best they can given how many responsibilities they have.
​
Both Ms. Hunter and Ms. Woods circled back to what Ms. Hunter called “one of the elephants in the room”: distrust between parishioners and the archdiocese. When asked about some parishioners’ distrust, Mr. Elliott responded by email on June 17 that throughout the months of April and May, archdiocesan representatives met with an estimated total of 200 parishioners from several New Haven churches on six separate occasions.
​
Father Lerner of St. Mary's: “We come to take pastoral care of this parish, and we do the best we can.”
​
“I believe that through these forums, which combined total roughly 18 hours worth of in-person engagement, as well as other efforts, we have exercised a high level of transparency and communication,” Mr. Elliott wrote.
​
In an interview in early June, Father Lerner said that for the most part, he thinks things are going fairly well, despite a few glitches. **America** asked Father Lerner about the town halls and listening sessions he mentioned in a prior interview. While he originally intended to host such sessions, he wrote in an email on June 9, it “quickly became apparent that opinions and feelings were all over the place.” A resultant “toxic” atmosphere, combined with outsiders—for example, people with little connection to St. Mary’s, or people who lived outside Connecticut—who would loudly comment on the situation, led him to determine that something else was needed.
​
“I felt that providing an open forum where a few voices might dominate the conversation, and pose issues that I as the new pastor would not have been in a position to address, would have proven unhelpful, deepen wounds, and potentially worsen an already tense situation,” Father Lerner wrote. He added that he felt a more “ordered and quantitative analysis” of the situation would be best.
