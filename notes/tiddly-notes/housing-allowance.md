The following resolution was duly adopted by the vestry of St. Paul's at a regularly scheduled meeting held on July 19, 2021, a quorum being present:

Whereas, Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code permits a minister of the gospel to exclude from gross income a church-designated allowance paid to him/her as part of his/her compensation to the extent used by him/her for actual expenses in owning or renting a home; and

Whereas, The Rev. Dale C. Hathaway is compensated by St. Paulâ€™s exclusively for services as a minister of the gospel; and

Whereas, St. Paul's does not provide The Rev. Dale C. Hathaway with a rectory, therefore, it is hereby

Resolved, that the total compensation paid to The Rev. Dale C. Hathaway for the calendar year 2021, August through December, shall be $15,000 of which $5,000 is hereby designated to be a housing allowance; and it is further

Resolved that the designation of $1,000 per month as a housing allowance shall apply to calendar year 2022 and all future years unless otherwise provided.
