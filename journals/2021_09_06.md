	  The most terrible nightmare. I'm awake now because this was going on for an hour it seemed. I was at a museum kind of affair. It was Hawai'i, but not a place that I knew. I was in the company of Bill Mok and family. I was estranged from my wife – I guess it was Bridget – but we were somehow together at this museum. But we got separated. I was with the Mok's. And the nightmare was that I couldn't do anything. My phone didn't work. Then I lost it. I lost the car. I was wrestling with the leftover things in the little place I was staying in. **I wanted to go home. But I couldn't**. I couldn't figure it out. I felt stupid. Then abandoned. I was on my own.
